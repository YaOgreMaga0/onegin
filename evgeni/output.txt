A 'wealthy yonth and handsome too;
A Grandison attached to cards,
A Kalmuck, spectacled and worn,
A Kantian, unspoiled and truthful,
A Moscow winter was the thing.
A Moslem in his paradise.
A Muscovite in Harold’s cloak,
A balalaika gives me pleasure,
A ballroom tyrant, tightly laced,
A barrier that is no more,
A beau, a sergeant of the Guards.
A bigot seem — a patriot —
A black reproach in every word.
A black-firocked monk, or if a hare
A bleeding roastbeef’s on the table.
A book, a walk where shadows flitted
A brace of pistols and two balls 
A brazen fellow, starched and proud.
A classicist in such a fray.
A clue to joys beyond all measure.
A clumsy goose, and thinks to put 
A comrade’s promising career,
A cosmopolitan — or what?
A cottage with two rowan trees,
A country house he next may see —
A creature arid, cold, and vain.
A cross, a question-mark, a word —
A crouching huntsman, ill -concealed, 
A crowd of nymphs around her — lo!
A cue rests on the table -top.
A danger to all lovely ladies,
A decent chap — ^like you and me?
A deep economist, indeed,
A delicate green down assuming.
A dinner that was rather festive.
A down-stuffed couch are all, I think.
A dream . . . Cousine^ do you recall 
A drop of pity, you^ll forebear 
A drop of the dark fragrant stream;
A dwarf, whose tail is quite a feature,
A faddist and a firebrand.
A fairy light about her playing,
A fairy tale that lasts the night,
A fop gone bald, toil’s arrant foe.
A friend in need, as you will gather —
A frontier shattered by the war
A frosty slight; the heavens muster
A gambler who won all the stakes,
A garden river-girt, and lo!
A gay mazurka holds the crowd;
A gentle sandy slope will please,
A giddy fop, and cruel spleen
A gifted talker, he would chatter
A girl will more than once forego.
A glance at many a curious book.
A glum, and next a merry man;
A good landed proprietor,
A gossip, glutton, clown, and cheat,
A gravestone tells its mournful story.
A guest comes, an indifferent player;
A habit, Lensky.” ^"^Oh, but clearly,
A halcyon bucolic scene,
A haughty general after her.
A haughty skeleton, and that
A heart that had not felt a pang —
A holy secret, and a voice 
A horn rang out, as in a dream;
A horrid shout assails the walls
A housewife seems a perfect treasure!
A kindred soul, he held, was burning
A kitchen and a fence below.
A land imagination hallows:
A laugh would bring the pair together?
A letter heartfelt, artless, candid;
A lexicon of snobbery
A lily of the valley blowing
A lively horse, but not too restive,
A living picture, or a jest.
A loaf is proffered, coins are taken,
A lyre that bears a little dove;
A man of rank, his worthy father
A man of sense, I am conceding,
A merry tune that, all unwilling,
A mighty music down the ages.
A mirror on the moon, now waning;
A missive eloquent of passion.
A mob-cap and a dressing-gown.
A mocking demon stirs within me
A modern Regulus; at need 
A moment since, this heart was quickened 
A moment, and the pair once more
A monarch weak and also cunning,
A monogram he found too mazy,
A more magnificent reward.
A namby-pamby, colorless
A nice old woman, plain but pleasant.
A night of magic, and a moon . . .
A nobler page, more fine and true,
A noise off in the servants’ quarters 
A noisy brood. Not without fighting.
A northern ball in all its glory,
A note of Lensky’s composition;
A novelty framed to divert him;
A pallid swarm, the patients pour:
A pampered boy, allured by pleasure.
A passing thought’s enduring trace
A pattern spread; and soon what yearning 
A pitch-sealed bottle they were serving 
A place for the old-fashioned splendor: 
A place is found for every guest
A pleasant notoriety?
A pledge of every loveliness.
A poem to her on the spot.
A poppy could not match your face.”
A portrait of none else but me,
A precious pledge! The man was guided
A prize that chanced to come his way:
A proper distance to allow,
A pure love’s innocent effusion;
A regimental band is coming!
A rival, or to catch him napping.
A row of dinners, dull and sure,
A rustic view that she found fetching,
A scholar in a yellow shawl!
A second, and a third he sends,
A serf-boy takes his dog out sleighing,
A series of fatiguing scenes.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
A shadow, or a wife, pursues
A shaggy bear! At Tanya’s cry
A shelf of books he’s been perusing.
A simple Russian family
A simple monument is placed.
A slender crescent riding high.
A smile, Onegin is appealing 
A snare to maids’ imaginations)
A snowball down the hill goes tumbling
A snowdrift stirs, it falls asunder:
A soldier’s, wins us friends at Court,
A soldier spouse and a campaign.
A song across the waters drifted;
A song he brings for Tanya’s pleasure.
A spider; here a red-capped skull 
A spirit brooking no dictation?
A starry host of choiring spheres 
A stroke of genius, nothing less.
A sudden gust of wind surprises
A summer in the country, racing 
A swarm of thoughts exempt from blame.
A sweet remembrance to ensure.
A tale of sentiment not new,
A talked-of novel, rather hazy,
A tavern tribune, chief of rakes.
A tedious season they await
A tender father, a good master.
A thing Albani might have done;
A thing the winter could not chain;
A thought in which he acquiesced.
A thought was born, and grew, unbidden;
A tomb, a temple vowed to love,
A torrent gray with foam is pouring;
A touch, and the sharp cliffs are beveled,
A trespasser may hope for pardon.
A tumult in the Russian heart!
A veritable poet, yonder.
A very pedant in the youth.
A veteran W'ho never fails
A village view she seemed to know,
A virgin of ripe years, accepts
A wanton sigh was not worth mention:
A way for her; he’s happy if 
A welcome; it was not surprising 
A white cap shows, all in a trice:
A wind -mill all alone is whirling.
A word to solace and to save me:
A worthy course of action finds: 
A wretched ghost, a foreign joke
A young girl’s ardor, clear of guile.
A youth, who on the snow seems dozing;
AND FROM THERE TO THE CAUCASUS:
AU jealous thoughts evaporated —
Abandoning his pleasant village.
About her early indiscretion . . .
About her older sister now.
About his Olga; it may be.
About its magic healing fountains,
About the hills and meadows lying.
About the past, what’s done and gone; 
About the self-same thing, this clacking 
About the table monsters sit!
About the weather, flax, and cattle . . .”
About this common rustic view;
About: a noisy laughing host . . . 
Above her spinning-wheel’s low rattle;
Above it all, the wild applause.
Above the chess-board they will sit.
Above the domes of Moscow, dazing 
Above this modest urn there hung 
Abruptly down the incline bounding,
Absorbed in bitter meditation
Absorbed the girl, and she was thrown 
Accomplished as a vile coquette!
Accomplished in the end. Three cheers!
Across in safety to the path;
Across the meadowland alone,
Across the pane a shadow edges:
Admired — ^in sketching whom you blunted 
Admires alone Terpsichore 
Admiring glory, loving freedom,
Afar: the serpent and the tree 
Affairs of state, and over there 
Affected a most nasal '^'n”;
Affection’s pledge, indeed, expressing
Affection^ s spark in you^ believing 
Afraid before the headsman’s axe.
Afraid to stop: the bear is near;
African origin. His great-grandfather, Abram Petro- 
After an evening’s dissipations
After they’ve quarreled once again;
After this imexpected meeting,
Again a book was his sole crony —
Again her pale face looms before him,
Again imagination’s kindled.
Again, you’ll meet her, ’pon my life!”
Against a door, remarks with meaning 
Against the palm that holds it tight: 
Age comes to all, my darling, duly.
Aghast at time’s swift slipping sands.
Aghast, Tatyana recognized
Ah, dreams! where has your sweetness vanished?
Ah, friends, how I rejoiced, beholding
Ah, little feet, how I did love them!
Ah, my poor Lensky, he was made 
Ah, once how fast my heart would beat
Ah, spring, fair spring, the lovers’ season,
Ah, whither, whither did you flee?
Ah, yes, I knew such old wives’ tales,
Ah, yes, at some far distant date,
Ah, you are lovely, shores of Tauris,
Ail this is futile, and you know it,
Aind in a letter to a j&riend
Alas! by God’s strange will we must 
Alas! by a friend’s hand was slain.
Alas! the altar-fire is quenched.
Alas, it is not hard to guess!
Alas, our poor Onegin’s smitten:
Albani, an Italian painter of the seventeenth century, 
Albeit still a bachelor,
All’s hushed: within the parlor, sighing
All Eugene knew is past relating.
All Russia . . .
All candor and all grace in you.
All children know the melody:
All covered with the brittle snow;
All crowd into the drawing-room 
All day she roams the woods and mopes.”
All during the ensuing year.
All evening Lensky was distracted,
All greedy boredom’s progeny.
All greeted and congratulated
All hope is gone! He leaves, and curses
All hope, for aye, who enter here.”
All hustle, bustle, tell great lies,
All in good time, serene and thrifty —
All is foreseen: when I confess
All kin and kennels, crops and wine;
All labor, took to pensive ways; 
All life before us still lay fair.
All my past life has had one meaning —
All nonchalance and charm and grace,
All one might care to be or know;
All point to her, and all combine
All rise; he marches to the door.
All secrets safe. Tatyana sleeps.
All speaks of him, but to confound her;
All this is now outworn and faded,
All this lends charm to conversation.
All this was but the bored profession
All thoughts, but those of you, rejected.
All wish to see their daughters wed
All wonder whether they see rightly;
Allows a zest to oinr alarm.
Allured by neither looks nor station.
Ally or enemy, attend
Aloft, the whole of heaven sees;
Alone a lazy boatman lifted
Alone along the sea-shore; then
Alone among his new possessions,
Alone had eyes, and every speech 
Alone the shepherd, weak and hoary.
Alone, Tatyana broods, and soon
Alone, and sunk in calculation,
Alone? What of the eye-glass, eh?
Along dark streets wrapped deep in slumber
Along the forest path he crashes.
Already, ’neath the bridal crown.
Although I’ve glanced at, in times gone,
Although I find it so expressive.
Although he grew more melancholy,
Although her book has no pretensions
Although indeed I paid attention.
Although its touch be soft as fleece.
Although my freedom did not please me.
Although the house was empty, she 
Alw"ays together, now they’re sitting
Always the same and always novel.
Ambassador is speaking to?
Amid the snowdrifts, seething, roaring,
Amidst this dreary family,
Among her groves and meadows ranging.
Among sad chffs he moves. I’m fated
Among the crush of people passes,
Among the huts where Tartars dwell . . . 
Among the tents of nomads moving.
Among those regions drearily.
Amusement while you mix his potion;
An album verse with tender mien;
An alien, roving unrestricted,
An ancient, with perfumed gray hair, 
An ardent faith in liberty.
An eiffort to converse with her.
An escort much, puffed out his chest 
An exquisite both bold and natty.
An honest fellow, be it noted.”
An idle, cheerless recluse, near
An insect in a flower sunk;
An ordered way of life, confessing 
An uhlan wooed her, not in vain;
Ancestral Eve, you find delightful 
Ancestral portraits in the gloom
And . . . could not. Now she spoke, inquiring
And /ar niente is my law.
And Dunya squeaks (would she were dumb!)
And Eugene, when he saw these sirs —
And Flyanov, somewhat ill, encumber
And Fontenelle, acute, eupeptic;
And Grandison, who leaves us sleeping.
And I’d be happy . . . more or less!
And I’ve completed Chapter One.
And I admit, in penitence,
And I am such. Was it naught better
And I can’t say the clique is wrong 
And I confess I am perplexed:
And I have learned how to be meek*
And I shall speak, if you allow,
And I was just thirteen years old.
And I, all discipline refusing,
And Kura’s and Ajragva’s banks
And Lensky — Tanya; Kharlikova,
And Lensky, firm and unafraid.
And Lensky, grieving honestly,
And Lethe’s sluggish tide will swallow
And Lucifer’s hailed by the cock;
And Olenka’s. Why say them nay?”
And Russians too he would peruse:
And Strasbourg pies, imperishable;
And Tanya’s heart began to glow.
And Tanya enters. Here her prince.
And Tanya found the journey bleak.
And Turkish pipes of amber rare,
And a shy maiden’s pure caress.
And ail would relish the report
And all distraction finds her jaded,
And all exclaim delightedly
And all seemed dull. But soon the reading
And all she looked on glistened white.
And all that Paris in her passion
And all that sparkles, triumphs, sings.
And all their w’ayward stirrings cease, 
And all, our tender dreamer fused 
And also our calm hours of leisure.
And always needing some correction,
And an eternal friendship plighted
And an old gentleman espied her,
And answer with the barest greeting.
And ardently this Muse of mine
And as a child she’d romp and play
And as a rural miss appears
And as he reads, both thought and feeling
And as he says farewell again 
And as it hisses, gently steaming.
And as on these his fancy dwelt,
And as she looked about, dejected, 
And as she reads, the tears will rise
And at the following sweet session
And at the stations lice and roaches
And at the tavern-door the clack
And at the window, not too grim.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And been a faithful wife and mother.
And behaved well, you will agree;
And bids his servant, since time presses,
And bids us cast away the wreath 
And blessed the darkness bringing rest.
And blessed the man who rids him of 
And blesses, as he halts his clamor,
And blissful still, since all unknowing,
And boasted, bold beyond all measure. 
And boasts the freedom of the wings,
And both, though young, could but await
And breathe the free air of the stage,
And brooklets murmured pleasantly, 
And brushes, thirty shapes and sizes.
And by the way, now that I mention
And by this shaking bridge affrighted,
And by those ashes, mourning truly,
And can you not forgive, if she
And carried to that region where
And caught that foot in these two hands;
And certain pages (fabrications,
And chats of this and that politely;
And chequered brown and gold and green, 
And cleverly convey a note.
And clinch the point with a quotation.
And closed his turbulent career 
And covering a yawn with laughter —
And coveting the fatal food;
And craved the forest’s shady boon.
And credit the world’s fair appearance; 
And crossed the girl, and as she made 
And crosses black with flocks of daws.
And cruel traitresses who smile.
And curls as black as they were long.
And curses their unwelcome leisure;
And damask of the drawing-room —
And dashes off. Before the morrow
And dashes uphill and is gone;
And day will brighten wold and wave,
And did his shade in sorrow yearn?
And does his somber aspect mean 
And does not cease to pine and fret.
And does not pay the least attention.
And doing with her as he will.
And doings, in a friendly fashion?
And dream about his native land.
And dreaming of his exultation
And dreams and musings far from gay.
And drink desire’s sweet poisoned potion.
And drop in stars upon the shore.
And drops. His clouded eyes betray
And drunken stamp of the trepak,
And earn me fame and sound and fury.
And empty — so it seems to us . . .
And entered. Here the throng is trooping; 
And enters softly without rapping,
And enters the deserted court.
And epigrams that scored a hit.
And every query, every tale,
And everywhere that you may turn
And far too wretched to be meek
And fashion, or a parody?
And faster, faster throbs her heart.
And fawn and play the hypocrite.
And feelings, long quiescent, stirred;
And feigned the pang of jealousy,
And find, wherever she may sally
And fled afar . . . She followed me.
And fleeing, breaks the lilac-bushes,
And for his mind, his rank does duty.
And for the pranks he liked to play
And for the simple churchyard, telling
And forthwith to a ball he flew.
And found a partner in another.
And found his comments sane and smart.
And found it rather hard to spell;
And found their prudent talk vexation;
And freighted with a youthful gloom 
And friendly husbands’ heavy cheer?
And friendship’s claims he was refusing.
And fright but bred fidelity;
And from the servants’ anxious eyes.
And gains the brookside, breathing fast.
And gave his neighbor’s ribs a dig.
And girls who kiss with laughs and hugs,
And glance, unwilling, in the glass.
And glances at the door by stealth.
And golden autumn is arriving.
And gorges seven days a week.
And gratefully to bed they creep; 
And grief changed to serenity.
And grow, with time, intelligent.
And guard your daughters more severely.
And guards in silence all the while
And gulp them down as they arrive,
And had grown ashen-cold and surly;
And had his last farewells to say.
And had no word for him but blame —
And halts in sudden deep confusion;
And hand meets hand, and hearts beat high; 
And hands him linen white as snow.
And hard and cold, and petrify 
And has she found the word? She lets
And having noted, in a pet.
And having stared through my lorgnette
And he had set her heart awhirl!
And he was busy anyway.
And he was not the least elated 
And he will throw you in a trice.
And he would have a deal to say . . .
And he, reluctant to surrender,
And health and hope and joy are banished:
And healthless look, his dumb remorse — 
And hear, above the lake, their cries,
And heedless of the winter fun.
And her head sinks. The dawn grows bolder, 
And here hussars on leave, resplendent
And here the regicidal dagger 
And here too was [Prolasov], stunted
And his brief look of tenderness —
And his cheek pale, she does not see 
And his the charm of simple art.
And holding him in such affection
And hotter yet the blush is glowing
And how it strikes me, never mind).
And hurriedly before it perished
And if her soul was deeply stirred,
And if that’s not enough to do,
And if the sudden sight dismayed her.
And in a voice pohte but reedy
And in an attitude confiding,
And in due time the husband passed 
And in exchange he took as well
And in her mind a billet-doux
And in her soul was resurrected
And in high London circles, they 
And in our names (and in our verses);
And in that far and savage spot
And in the court gay magpies screamed;
And in the crowd that filled the hovel,
And in the grave his bones have rest!”
And in the mist her little finger
And in the misty moonlight furled.
And in the sleigh most carefully
And in these nobles he would see
And integers: ourselves alone.
And into the deep forest plunges;
And is the vernal crown of youth 
And it is %^ery hard to bear
And it is precious, being brief:
And it is weighted down with snow;
And its cold white magnificence:
And its late sequel as absurd.
And ivory balls, not more than two.
And jealous in a frigid way.
And jealous longing frets the maid —
And kept him underneath her rule.
And know that heart will never quicken?
And lands remote, where on the breast
And lean upon it with assurance . . .
And leave the forests gaunt and harsh.
And leaves the little hovel shaking , . . 
And let his tears unheeded shower;
And lifts his hand as who defies
And lightly clad, though airs were chill,
And likes the pallid evening light
And likewise do not find beguiling
And lives like a true sage at last,
And locked him in a corner where
And longing thus, be forced to meet you
And looks, and calls him . . . But no power
And love’s delicious dream, and, too,
And love is but the devil’s tool.
And loved the duties well fulfilled.
And many a solemn protestation 
And mists above the meadows brooded;
And modern man’s true soul divulging:
And more play whist, whose fame’s enduring —
And mortgaged all the land he owned.
And most, the linden-shaded ways
And murmur sing-song confidences,
And my Zaretzky, as I said,
And my heart whispered: it is he!
And my own man I want to be.
And near a stream, stood calm and proud, 
And neighbor wheezes unto neighbor.
And never after that went near it.
And never loved where it desired,
And never said his passions nay.
And next he dressed . . .
And next the girl’s guitar we see;
And night would find her far from sleep. 
And nightmares and hallucinations.
And no calumnious friend so pert
And none can hear his neighbor speak.
And not a single w^ord deleted;
And not a station will be known
And not long years of separation,
And not without a tell-tale blush.
And notes complexions, with a sneer
And nothing to remark or pardon;
And now Zaretzky measures off
And now for the first time I’m bringing
And now she leaps and claps her heels.
And now the guests, exchanging glances.
And now the one-armed prince had beckoned
And now they bring out eighteen jades.
And now what of Onegin? Truly
And now, at spring’s bright invitation.
And now, since I’ve no more to tell,
And nowhere is a spot of ink.
And nurses scream and children roar.
And of repeating platitudes,
And of the glorious days of old,
And offer hospitality.
And oh, they are a weary weight!
And old companions, dull and vicious;
And on Caucasian cliffs how often.
And on her lips a careless smile.
And on her shoulder leans his head;
And on the last page this reflection:
And on the lovage dropped a tear.
And on their skates the merry boys
And once I gave my meager all
And one fibne morning finds him flying
And one may find a mirror lying
And one thing more put us asunder —
And one would find the children roaming
And other cares, severe, distressing,
And out of an old-fashioned notion
And pen; good night.” Her single taper
And people later, with a frown,
And pity took the place of anger.
And plait his humble footgear there.
And pleading first that by-and-by
And pleasant though it is to roam.
And plunged in sorry thought, more slowly
And ponder each move’s secret meaning.
And praise Odessa’s gardens greatly.
And presses her soft hand — elation
And pride that ever looks askance.
And prim young misses looking sage;
And promised them each year again
And prompts something satirical;
And purr the while: Tatyana saw
And puts her little hand at length 
And quite as faithless as their feet.
And raise love’s value cleverly;
And raised his nose above the rest.
And raises fowls, while at his knee
And rash the question that she broaches:
And re-upholstered for the trip.
And resolute, she shipped the peasant
And rightly, but his pain was such
And rightly: for Onegin, sitting
And roam the sea’s expanse, unpent.
And roamed its gardens at my ease,
And rootless dreams that could not last,
And round the loaded carriage crowded,
And sadly, virginally sighing,
And scrapes his chair along the floor;
And search my nonsense for some wit.
And seat the two friends hastily.
And seemed about to faint and fall;
And sees the gaping fiends of hell:
And send them, armed, from Led at dawn,
And sentimentally devoted
And sentinel to sentinel 
And served each course to them by rank.
And setting up a new regime;
And shall return to him, I vow,
And sharing leisure, thoughts, and food,
And she — she who for Tanya posed . . . 
And she will learn my knowledge of
And she, not knowing men are heartless,
And show commercial enterprise.
And shrewdly held his peace; in sport
And shun the heart that would be tender.
And silently recall the past?
And silhouetted by the beams,
And sings, off key. The song is greeted
And sinks from sight, soon to be crumbling. 
And sleep at last her boon conferred;
And sleighing, and, when light grew dimmer,
And slept beside her every night.
And slowly by a secret network
And smoothly glide on polished boards; 
And snoring, heavy Pustyakov 
And so God grant them health and cheer!
And so all hail to you, nine Muses, etc.”
And so for days poor Tanya broods.
And so from idle talk she flies.
And so he’ll rifle keener minds;
And so her quick imagination
And so inflexible their virtue.
And so of course the girl decided
And so the bumptious guild denies him;
And so the guests would say good-bye.
And so the morrow passes, too —
And so they aged, like all things mortal,
And so was captured by the French —
And so without more words, departed;
And so, my home was then Odessa . . .
And solitude — this was, in fine,
And some harsh judges found, forsooth,
And sometimes in my heart I own
And sometimes neatly made retort.
And soon the east will be alight;
And soon their tongues begin to race.
And sooth, I fled these haughty belles 
And stares unseeing, in no hurry
And staring in dismayed surprise,
And started on his aimless cruising.
And steamed herself on Saturday —
And steps across; her Mood congeals;
And still our Eugene lies abed
And stop defenceless in the field.
And strolling with the throng you’ll view
And such a crowd, a perfect rabble . .
And suddenly he’s at the gate.
And sulked, and swore that he would trim
And swift to flee from fun and folly,
And talk that brighten’s friendship’s ways.
And tears of reconciliation
And tedious planned holidays.
And tells her doll with anxious thought
And terror-stricken would await
And that between her teeth, to greet 
And that for many a long day.
And that it cheated us again;
And the cool yawns that come amain. 
And the deep seas His praise rehearse
And the fond fool would then pursue
And the grave eyes that have undone me
And the improvement will be splendid! 
And the long evenings black as ink.
And the opinion of the town . . .
And the polite world’s hurly-burly.
And the poor girl is roused betimes
And the rare magic of the Muse
And the same pom, and the same spouse, 
And the smooth waters, mirror-bright,
And the two friends for death competing, 
And the word’s new — should not be great.
And the world smiled upon her, pressing
And the young city miss who’s facing
And then appeared a row of glasses.
And then at home all day he stays
And then once more till noon sleep sound.
And then sat silent for the nonce.
And then the wayward course of passion. 
And then, refreshed after a dipping,
And then, with Olga, how he acted!
And there’s a witch with a goatee,
And there a traveler from a distance,
And there beside the rocky shallows
And there he also wrote another
And there she stayed, and wept, and wept.
And there the weary ploughmen dally.
And there were those who said they knew
And they delight to see it flow.
And thin, but pretty, more or less;
And think of it! So timid is he,
And this routine was to his taste.
And those I do not greatly me;
And though he was an ardent rake,
And though the talk of my yotmg friend
And thought he met with no rebuff.
And thought, I do not doubt, of me.
And through the frosty window-pane
And throws this challenge in our teeth:
And thunderous, flock eagerly:
And thus reduce him to confusion;
And time would pass, and there would be
And to a humble cottage dashes:
And to his stand the cabby goes.
And to my lips the words came thronging;
And to put finis to their chatter;
And to the final pages turning.
And took his medal for a toy
And treading toes, between the chairs 
And trifles of importance to
And truffles, luxury of youth,
And trusted her with house and pelf,
And tucked away, an almanac
And tunnels under water, too.
And turn the meadow to a marsh 
And turned a joyful face to greet him
And turns to what is hers no more:
And urged along the outbreak’s course.
And vainer labor there is none —
And valleys, trees, and hamlets seemed 
And virtue won its due reward.
And visit at the Christmas season,
And w^ept his father and his mother . . .
And w^ho could wield the poet’s pen. 
And wake the birds in beech and larch.
And walk him in the afternoon.
And was at Olga’s ere he knew it!
And watch her, languidly enchanted!
And watch life’s furrows briefly nourish
And watch the failing of his breath,
And wdth a heart for love designed,
And what a throat! And what a spirit! . . .
And what of my Onegin? Drowsing,
And what the fashions were that fall.
And what the moon might signify.
And what was my amazement, finding
And when a star dropped down the sky
And when consoled by art — and fame,
And when the little girls collected
And when their wives talked, it was worse.
And when they entered, arm in arm,
And when we find our old devotion 
And when, at midnight, madcap Russians,
And when, besides, her heart was wrung:
And where he left a lasting trace.
And where indeed of her they’re prating.
And where one falls, another surges . . .
And where the faithful suitor hovers,
And where the youthful galaxy
And where two pines their shadows fling
And while a husband is respected
And while my wanton muse rejoices
And while the breakfast is preparing
And while the world in silence slept.
And while they all are in high feather,
And whispering, make quite a stir:
And who, then, came to our assistance
And whom shall we confide in, pray?
And whom we kiss as they expect,
And why? What am I striving for?
And will accustom us to grammar;
And window -sashes rattled loudly.
And with a cheerful eye to greet you ! —
And with a somber splendor shone
And with enamored eyes to see
And with good cheer and merry sally
And with love’s sw^eet confusion dizzy,
And with my vanished spring, it seems,
And with strange languor fill my blood!
And with the malice time imposes.
And with the spark of a bon mot
And without foolish affectation.
And wore — her last defences down —
And wore the funeral wTeath at last.
And worn in comfort, far from town.
And yet Odessa, our wet city,
And yet her face was pale and clouded
And yet her trust he’d not belie,
And yet more pleasant, on the sly
And yet she found it no affliction —
And yet the auguries perplex her.
And yet win luster from my writing;
And yet, were morals not in question,
And you shall judge me as you may.
And you, bright phantoms round him thronging,
And you, can you remain the same?
And you, my dear, are doomed to perish;
And you, my fair ideal, too,
And you, my reader, wise and witty.
And you, oh, youthful inspiration,
And you, skilled pupils of Levshin,
And young in youth; blessed is he 
And your remarkable collection
And, careless of the cold, is training
And, feeling they had done their best,
And, fortune’s darling, in his rhyming
And, if my novel is to thrive.
And, seated, eagerly is eyeing
And, there at home, for Russia sigh.
And, with no aim on which to fix,
Anew the garrulous fond lyre?
Angel or fiend, as you prefer.
Anisya surely won’t ignore them;
Anna’s reign, Annibal, who had incurred Biihren’s 
Annibal’s curious life is known only from stories pre- 
Announce the coming of his bales.
Announces it is dinner-time.
Another’s amorous invention
Another’s grief is hers to rue,
Another’s joy her heart possesses. 
Another’s, and his memory 
Another ! . . . No, I could have given
Another day without an aim;
Another day: he still is dumb;
Another demon seizing me,
Another landowner come newly
Another neighbor tapped his skull:
Another set of lines transpired 
Another, at a god’s dictation.
Anticipating this distraction.
Apart, Tatyana can but linger
Aplomb, he lifts his eye-glass, stares
Appeal, complaint, confession, sobbing 
Appears, his broom in hand, still blinking;
Appendix
Approach!” How calm and cold their faces.
Approached her pillow, she would raise 
Archives of the Foreign Office.
Are all but flowing; her heart flutters,
Are all your relatives quite w ell?
Are certain that it only means 
Are charming, friends, but I would put
Are cordial to the country cousins.
Are crammed with all that’s necessary:
Are dazzling, and rejoice our hearts.
Are far too pleasant to seem long.
Are found absurd or else offensive 
Are glad at last to take a rest:
Are guarding fur-coats faithfully;
Are here cast off, or so the flighty 
Are here, with scissors straight and curved. 
Are in them, and the sparkle of 
Are just the same as what they were; 
Are lulled to sleep, and readily 
Are quite forgot- The path is now 
Are quite perplexed by such as she:
Are roaring the recitative.
Are settled: they are fast asleep;
Are such a man would rather bleed
Are turned by one cool glance to ice,
Are waltzing round the dancing-floor.
Are you a guardian angel to me?
Armenian, Spaniard, Frenchman, Greek,
Aroused your pity then . . . You’re kneeling 
As Eugene stares his heart is chilled
As Eugene, by regrets distracted.
As I am, too, a little rest:
As I fared onward gloomily,
As I her rustic charms survey.
As Lensky’s life that knew no guile,
As a fit sequel to the roast:
As a good comrade, one who shares 
As at a mighty funeral feast;
As custom bade; with charm and spell 
As did the bard — yet not aquiver
As did this author: chief of all 
As do the sins of years long fled 
As does proud Moscow, in its rights.
As erstwhile comes, to hum an air
As every spring the sapHngs show
As fancy in the lot would trace 
As fields are blest by storms of spring:
As grateful as a kiss, as simple
As he comes near; it’s no illusion:
As he depicted their delights;
As he was followed by the blues.
As her good nurse w^ould have her do:
As hermits live who hope for heaven
As his repellent aid he proffers;
As in a nightmare each one aims
As infant slumbers, as the moon
As many wiles as I could mention 
As men need air, they found kvass needful,
As my confession. Why say more?
As on a shaky bench he lays her.
As on another road I fare.
As one who fought forgotten wars
As one who through a fog is peering,
As only passion can have wrought.
As perfect as an illustration —
As rock and wave, or ice and flame.
As she says gently: ^^Rise; have done.
As she surveyed him . . . His dejected 
As some time later to assert
As suddenly grew timorous,
As that of one beneath a spell.
As the dark coverts were denuded;
As the two foes, with even tread.
As though a chiQy hand were laid
As though he’s surely done with books.
As though she feared an inquisition
As though there were a tacit ban
As through the dust his horses fare.
As upon any other day.
As well as write; and how he bowed!
As wild as they: forsook her songs 
As years went by, and readily
As you discover life’s allures,
As, my Onegin, I drop you.
As, sped like arrows from the bow.
Ashamed to own his every feature;
Ashore at last, and our endeavor 
Aside all timid thoughts, forgetting 
Askance at fair, unwonted faces,
Asked what Onegin’s visit meant,
Asked who she was, set straight his wig,
Asleep j&rom boredom?” "Not at all.”
At Carnival in savory cheer,
At Christmas, carols were their pleasure;
At Europe’s dainty handicraft,
At Whitsun, when the populace
At a soiree. '^God! to see her! . . .
At any gathering or dance,
At bottom, and, too bored to think.
At cards with his inheritance!
At dawn tomorrow, near the mill;
At dawn, by Cytherea’s light.
At dusk a sleigh’s the thing, and caMng:
At dusk the samovar is gleaming
At either end the two friends stand.
At everything she gazes on;
At fifteen feet: his aim was good.
At first Eugene began to dream
At first Madame controlled the child;
At first but wept and tore her hair.
At first disturbed me, in the end 
At first these were but machinations
At giddy feasts and wild discussions,
At heart, giving a single jot.
At him . . . And if she was amazed,
At home his pistols claimed attention;
At last for whom her heart is yearning 
At last he rouses, opens wide
At last she rose, and gently sighing
At last, by night, arrived the snow*
At least of some complaint arthritic?
At least, if pity seemed to soften
At length our hollow-hearted hero
At mere epistolary prose.
At noisy gatherings and after.
At once he offered with a smirk
At once that guests might be expected.
At once the slanderer to defy.
At once, and bear the weapon -case.
At peace, it is my artless pleasure
At slaughter, with a heart of leather . . .
At table, ’neath the damask cover.
At that she could no longer hide
At the age of eighteen Annibal was sent by the
At the back porch in readiness,
At the casino cosily;
At the commencement of my story
At the gay spectacle turned hollow. 
At the sad turning of the years,
At the spinet, then swiftly quitting 
At thirty profitably wed.
At this unlucky moment, we
At times she pays him no attention;
At twenty to the fashion bred,
At whiles, upon their elbow's leaning,
Aunt Pelageya still possesses
Ausonia’s happy sons are trilling 
Avails to rouse him: he is gone.
Away already: without fail.
Away forever, was so near! . . . 
Away with Olga, nothing loth;
Away, his profile may be seen ...”
Away, the good old sleigh, at last. 
Away, while the old sleigh was mended 
Awhile all conversation ceases;
Ay is risky, if delicious;
Ay, when, foaming gold, it hisses . . .
BARATYNSKY
BE THOU SPARED THESE FEARFUL DREAMS,
BYRON
Bakhchi-Sarai.”
Bare steppe is all you will behold;
Bared silently, as in a dream.
Baroness Barbara von Kriidener; St. Preux and Wol- 
Bassoon and flute at once are heard.
Bat have one things when you were gone^
Be fact, and can my spring be past 
Be patient, then, as with a brother:
Be quick! Drive on!” he bids the peasant;
Be ruled by what is small and mean?
Be sentenced by a crooked jury 
Be she? It is . . . But no . . . And yet . . .
Be sure you have your grandson go.”
Be thou my staffs nor let me stray.
Be thrilled upon Elysian ways 
Bearing her jar o’er creaking snows;
Bears the proud burden of her rank!
Because he could make no bon mot.
Because he hated litigation
Because it’s long since I have sinned.
Because my husband’s decoration,
Because rash ardor and quick wit
Because society’s conventions,
Because the tune is so diverting,
Because there are no words in Russian
Because there was not much to pay,
Because they lacked — hadn’t one heard? — 
Because your honor and your pride 
Because, between the lines before him. 
Been married long?” ^’Two years.” whom?”
Befits and pleases you and me?”
Before a storm; I wanted, too,
Before her charge, whose eyes were full.
Before her door; he waits for her;
Before her now, without a doubt:
Before him, loud with seething trajfl&c,
Before it’s heard, is grave and quiet.
Before the altar, head cast down.
Before the threshing-floor, thick willows 
Before they halted at a gateway 
Before whom my bold lyre is muted,
Before, her bow was as serene.
Begged that her husband sniffer her
Begins to raise his pistol coolly.
Beheld the bed where all must lie,
Behind a hill the moon is hidden;
Behind a stump among the trees
Behind the curtain’s funeral fold
Behind the mill they went straightway.
Behind the strange bed’s silken curtain
Behold each generation flourish,
Behold the Russian tents in ranks.
Behold! from town arrives — what rapture!
Beholding Lensky. ^^Well?” Forthrightly
Beholding bareness everywhere.
Belong to youth, with youth are fled.
Beloved ... or such was his conviction,
Below that other’s signature
Below you see the river wind
Below, though it is early yet,
Beneath her pillow, empty playthings;
Beneath her pillow. Darkness keeps 
Beneath his fingers would have hurled 
Beneath it: d. v. Annette”;
Beneath my Afric’s sunny sky,
Beneath the Finnish sky, alone.
Beneath the light of stars and lamps.
Beneath the prudent flag of peace.
Beneath the shade of his acacias
Beneath their sky he plucked his lyre,
Benedetta sia la madre: a Venetian baracarolle.
Beshtau, the sharp-peaked, the eternal
Beside a stream, or on a hill.
Beside his heavy mate is lying.
Beside his wife, that chubby charmer.
Beside my quiet lake, beset 
Beside that most superb of creatures,
Beside that stream with shadows laced
Beside the fire a table’s set.
Beside the fire and hum to it 
Beside the stanza all unfinished
Beside the window. So life passes . . .
Beside the window; on the pane 
Best leeches send him to the spas.
Betrayed — he took a welcome rest. 
Betrayed no anger, no surprise 
Betrays my stomach, and although 
Between Lafitte and Veuve Cliquot, 
Between a rascal and a bore;
Between her hours of toil and leisure
Between two aunts, beside a post,
Bewildering the wretched man.
Beyond the grave, yes, at the end 
Beyond, the Caucasus’ tall masses,
Beyond, the plain, with hamlets dotted,
Birch, linden, aspen, all are bare;
Black chasm were gaping at her feet . . . 
Blase, growm tired of empty leisure.
Bleak tete-a-t^te concludes; he cheers 
Blessed is he who could be merry
Blessed is he who leaves the glory 
Blessed the new master every day.
Bloomed like a flower in the shade;
Bore to the grave to sleep forever 
Born of a liar in an attic.
Both carriages and people flounder.
Both friends and foes (they’re ail the same).
Both love and malice scarce recalling, 
Both tongue and seal are pink, are dry.
Bottles of cellar-cooled light wine:
Bowed lower, sought to catch her eye;
Breathes through the words she is inditing.
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Briefly surveying every tier.
Bucolic piece! Good Lord, have pity!
Built by the fishermen was flaring.
Bumps down Tverskaya Street already.
But Eugene’s sole preoccupation
But Eugene, now his friend was gone, 
But I’m a dunce! They bade me say
But I became another’s wife;
But I foresee a fresh objection.
But I grow old, and memory fails;
But I salute hope’s shy intrusion,
But I, my friend, am not contending
But Tanya’s mother, not ignoring
But Tanya does not share our pleasure.
But Tanya had no tears at all;
But Tanya, dreaming, hardly hears,
But Tasso’s murmured octaves are,
But all too soon the summer ends.
But are those stirrups he is hearing?
But as for me . . . my loving praise
But as the rural dusk advances
But at eighteen that is the rule;
But at her window, fain to weep.
But at the late and sterile season,
But bears refreshment and renewal —
But brings to mind our fading years 
But business holds the greater part.
But by rule only, and he doted
But by some influence despotic.
But by the window she would brood
But by your will; my fate* s decided;
But curious, as maidens are,
But dinner’s served, and arm in arm
But drops it without more ado.
But ere ’tis open, fades and crumbles.”
But even then, and more’s the pity,
But ever sadder, ever fonder.
But fast or slow, leave town behind!
But fiery youth cannot dissemble
But find the North is not my style.
But first he answers: ’’Agafon.”
But first, what dark delight you cherish, 
But for my part I do not mind
But for my wretched fate preserving
But for one thing he had a bent,
But for that sermon do not think
But from the ones we love and trust,
But have a warm, frank welcome for you.
But he refuses; he’s preparing
But he will back you while you live,
But heedlessly; she cannot school
But her good husband loved her dearly,
But her soul aches, and nothing pleases.
But here’s our lady unattended.
But here is tea: the girls demurely
But his grave illness, I confess,
But hush! Our sternest critic rises
But in a corner who is standing,
But in my youth no one engaged 
But in parenthesis I mention:
But in their praises why be stringing
But it is late, he should be leaving;
But it was not capitulation
But journeys made in wintry weather
But just to tease your appetite;
But keep to their familiar ways:
But knew the most amusing stories
But left alone, Onegin sighed.
But left him bored to a degree,
But let us rather now inquire
But like a shadow moves about,
But listens with an absent smile.
But lo! from out the morning valley
But love grew greater, unreqmted;
But naught avails her girlish wrath;
But never mind the turn you gave me;
But never mind, let’s rather hurry
But no! — straight down the steps to meet him
But no! the whole thing came to naught.”
But no, our paths have separated.
But none as yet came near divining
But nothing hurts when you are playing;
But nothing offers consolation.
But now . . . the tombstone and its story
But now I am fed up with it;
But now a kind and simple father,
But now adieu, oh, golden playtime!
But now all minds are fogged and cloudy,
But now her reason and her will 
But now it’s time for the ballet.
But now the blue of evening darkens.
But now the heavy hammer’s pounding
But now, ’tis as a house forsaken.
But now, enough, have done; for you
But now, the prey of evil passion,
But oh, how deeply we must rue it.
But other fancies, dark and chill.
But our Onegin’s heart was stricken
But our Onegin’s out of range
But reasonable conversation.
But scarce did consciousness forsake him
But seeing Olga wouldn’t read ’em.
But she had heard of them a dozen
But she in whom my thoughts are rooted.
But she prepared a conflagration.
But she took fright, our shy Tatyana;
But she was slow of wit at best.
But silent as a sage he sat
But somehow his mere look averred
But soon was yawning while he raced:
But spend three hours before the glass,
But stepping forth she slips and tumbles;
But still she pants, her terror growing.
But tenderness his look did show.
But that is not my pleasure now.
But that the wedding was deferred
But the discussions I have heard, 
But the proud princess, cold and serious,
But the provincial town affords 
But the sad ruin brought no sigh
But then he never read a page.
But then he paused, and with his narrow
But then, it puts me to the test.
But there’s no need that I dissemble
But there’s no rule that has not any:
But they demand a madrigal!
But this bright sibilant potation
But this gay circle I deserted.
But those good friends who were insistent
But though Onegin’s peace forsake him
But though the arguments are keen,
But tiresome ghosts. Can we unmask him? 
But to endure I need one boon —
But to the garden let us race
But was true joy to Eugene granted 
But what availed her urgent passion?
But what w^as further to transpire 
But when he comes they notify him
But where Melpomene’s bold gesture
But where is my disjointed story?
But where no more one meets his face . . .
But whither in such anxious haste
But who does that is only choosing
But wishes them away with speed.
But with a new interpretation,
But with the living truth aglow,
But worldly quarrels breed the dread
But worse, what now you choose to do!
But wretched is the man who never
But years went rolling by, and then
But yet the pleasure’s dulled if he
But yielding to a dream’s distraction,
But you’re already dressed! God save me.
But you, Bordeaux, I always treasure
But you, chance volumes that in Hades
But, God, such boredom who would sample? —
But, Lord, before the evening’s ended 
But, Muse, you must forget the past.
But, every interruption spurning,
But, feeling the blind archer’s sting,
But, gentlemen, you may decline
But, heavens, what am I to do
But, lacking them, the joy’s diminished;
But, like a man of worth and sense,
But, rain or shine, each day his coach is
Buyanov’s hand she has refused,
Buyanov leads off Pustyakova;
By Fate’s imperious decree.
By God! I wish I could retract.
By Lensky and his love; light flashes;
By a dark hope of what might be.
By a most happy whim. Lord Byron
By a slim icicle united.
By a sly dodge or ready jape.
By a translated move or word,
By afternoon he will be waking.
By an assumed austerity;
By any wife who’s virtuous.
By candle-light she rose and dressed.
By chance, these verses have not perished;
By dinner, tea, and supper merely.
By dreams of a far country shaken.
By facile conquest swiftly tired.
By grandmammas and grandpapas.
By grove and stream and field and steep — 
By hate and dread, and strongly beat 
By her dull partner’s mood infected;
By honor’s dictates, was indeed 
By ladies in society . . .
By longing. I am ill, I fear:
By mental effort tranquilizing
By mocking glance or chilly word,
By new desires I am enchanted.
By night, in dalliance, sweeter far.
By nothing stirred, where all is dim.
By now the wine of poesy
By one emotion only stirred;
By one persistent thought he’s haunted.
By poetry and love, or sickened 
By rest, a novel torment, punished . . .
By solitude nowise dejected;
By some obscure presentiment.
By someone awkward and afraid.
By sullen time, and soon grow wry 
By thaw and grimy steps defaced.
By the Neva it may be you
By the still stream, with dusk descending.
By the young Olga’s winning ways,
By this delightful counsel guided,
By this most black and vengeful mood? 
By those whose parts are not extensive?
By tiresome rhymes and vain regret,
By too-sweet tea, the ladies’ meekness, 
By what Tolstoy’s fine brush created.
By what is his cold torpid soul
By words and looks insidious
By worldly approbation paid.
By your good friend, all without guile,
Calash^ kibitka, crowded sleigh.
Call it magnetic or hypnotic.
Can a man do? Go walking there?
Can be surprised, who is not stirred 
Can it be Eugene? Truly? . . . Aye!
Can it be she who only now
Can it be that Tatyana truly
Can only curse his wedding-day!
Can shovel silver with a spade;
Can the sad thought with which I flirted
Can this be she who long since wrote —
Can you, so generous, so keen.
Cannot eclipse her neighbor’s quite.
Careless of others’ joy and pain.
Caressed the tomb o’er which it swung.
Caressingly repaid your song?
Caricaturing every guest.
Carry this letter secretly
Catch the first stirrings of the heart.
Catherine’s reign at the age of ninety-two.
Caught fast, she cannot get away.
Ceased, like all else, to be amusing.

Cherries and red raspberries.
Close as a marmot would require —
Cold ashes hide no smoldering ember;
Come away, girls, come away!
Come here, my dear. Why, this seems all
Come home again, young Lensky duly
Come seek the stream that slowly goes 
Come to eternal rest, lies here.”
Come warm yourself where it is cozy;” 
Come, it is time to dine once more.
Come, rouse anew imagination —
Comes up to carry Olga off.
Commands your tender minstrelsy?
Commemorating one who’s gone;
Compelled young boughs, in sultry heat,
Complaint will make my pain no less.
Confide to it the wish she cherished.
Confound the senses suddenly.
Congratulations! Now we are 
Consequently, either I have the girth of a fifteen- 
Consoled the lady quite completely.
Consumed with terror, Tanya, quaking,
Consumption yet may overtake him.
Content in my old age to follow
Content, since habit, more or less,
Converse at ease, seem to rejoice.
Coquette believes; the old man dreams 
Cottin.
Could Russia pardon my defection
Could alter Lensky’s virgin soul 
Could drain each morning bottles three.
Could hoodwink the inteUigent;
Could not conceive how pompous Grimm
Could not wash down with Veuve Cliquot
Could scarce inspire young Lensky’s zest.
Could scarcely count them, should I try.”
Could she but have foreseen the meeting 
Could show him an approximation 
Crossing the ballroom’s polished floor.
Crowding, the trees about it grow,
Custodian of the desert, fills
Cut off before his hopes could bloom;
Czar to France, where he began his service in the 
DMITRIYEV
Dared clean his nails in front of him —
Dark Melmoth fills her wuth delight;
Darkly it rushes on amain,
Dawn’s air is sweet, she does not feel it.
Daylong, nightlong, thus to be bid 
Dear Olga is his only matter.
Dear friend, before this heart is nmnb —
Dear reader, pardon the betrayal;
Dear reader, what you are about-
Debates and friendly conversations;
Deceit and gossip, rings and tears,
Deceit exists, but clings with tender 
Decembrists. The saying has not been found in the 
Decipher epigraphs at sight.
Decked out as for a holocaust . . .
Deep drifted in the snowy hush.
Deep in the dust that time has laid.
Deep tenderness; perhaps he meant it.
Deep truths, or well-drawn scenes — yet not
Deferring to my wealth and rank.
Delight is mingled with distress
Delphine: the leading character in a novel of the same 
Described the town; we must admit.
Described with frenzied inspiration
Describes in pensive tracery 
Designed for you so sad a lot!
Desires that are too keen to slake.
Detractors, cowardly and vile,
Devoured Stendhal, the arrant skeptic.
Diana’s breast, the face of Flora,
Didelot enjoyed his victories
Dirk, door, eclipse, fir, ghost, ice, knave, 
Disdain sits silent in his eye; 
Dispatched his friend, and had his pleasure,
Displays her languor and her pride 
Displays to the indifferent crowed 
Disputing your small legacy.
Disturbed by ghosts of days gone by;
Diviners and Chaldean sages.

Do I thus give you an excuse?
Do me this favor, nurse, I pray.”
Do not be cross because I fail
Do not spy upon our games.
Does Eugene drive? Yes, I suspected
Don’t aim to cover it with glory:
Donning Ms wide-br imm ed Bolivar,
Down to the waterfront there stumbles
Downhill she_trudges, scarcely breathing.
Drenched, deluged, choked with viscous mud;
Dressed early, shadow-pale, and sighing,
Drew up his regiments in line.
Drinks wine from tumblers,” it was hissed;
Drives home to take his night’s repose,
Drives home; and so at last to bed:
Drunk as an owl, into a trench.
Dub you a rogue, which is unfair.
Dufresny, 1654-1724.
During a drunken conversation
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
ELLE ETOIT FILLE, ELLE ETOIT AMOUREUSE.
EUGENE ONEGIN GOES
Each detail of our friend’s attire.
Each hour of torment added fuel
Each long and narrow as your waist,
Each man must do as he prefers —
Each morning I awake proposing
Each morning by the Moscow chimes,
Each room he finds unoccupied.
Each rural mother hopes to capture.
Each smile of yours, each glance, each motion;
Each to the other slyly winking,
Each whispers from behind her hand:
Each with a weapon in his hand.
Early editors substituted this name for the asterisks 
Eavesdroppers, be off, auxiyl
Education; he was a stickler for purity in language. 
Egypt’s retired corsair too.
Egyptian pirate, but he was more probably a Moorish 
Eh, friend?” But no, attend again:
Eight times changed places since they started; 
Eliminated belle Nina,
Emboldened by his Olga’s smile,
Emotion is for clowns and fools.
Enchanted her while yet a child,
Enchanting, sparkling, frivolous.
Enjoy staid domesticity,
Enlightenment makes such as we 
Enlightenment may be belated
Ennui pervading the haul monde.
Enough to kill a reputation.
Enough! My soul is calm and quiet
Enough, sing other tunes, move on!” 
Enough. ’Tis time that I presented
Enough. Though late, I’ve done my duty,
Entreaties, vows, and foolish fears.
Ere yet the crystal with precision
Esteemed emotion, feeling none.
Etcetera. The glosses vex her.
Ethiopian.

Eugene alone goes home to sleep.
Eugene alone was framed to measmre
Eugene berates them, rolls his eyes.
Eugene flings wide the door: defenseless.
Eugene had long abominated
Eugene himself with eyes that burned
Eugene perused the sad epistle;
Eugene should not have been so rash.
Eugene was apt at keeping still;
Eugene was not alone in noting
Eugene, as he his turn awaited.
Eugene, more tolerant than many.
Europe has spurious wines to offer;
Even Didelot becomes a bore.”
Even a man of honor: thus
Even by accident is heard 
Even the pistol and the sword.
Examine Tanya silently
Except the stomach; I may mention 
Exceptions may be hard to find,
Excerpts
Excerpts from Onegin's Travels
Exhibiting the present age,
Expressing the discrimination,
Extolling you in tones of fire!
FARE THEE WELL, AND IF FOR EVER
FROM
FROM MOSCOW TO NIZHNI -NOVGOROD:
Fair Nina Voronskaya, who
Fair ladies who are sentimental —
Familiar hills, familiar alleys.
Far back to a lost spring, and we.
Farewell! Forever, or for years?”
Farewell, proud palace! But why wait?
Farewell, you friendly skies of home;
Fat merchants, Cossacks, boulevards,
Fate guarded Eugene, our young waster;
Fate had arranged it otherwise.
Fate plans a different conclusion . . .
Fear of censorship seems to have been a minor factor; 
Fed by his slipper or review.
Feeling and thought with music’s strain.
Fell at her feet, his heart contracted;
Fie finds suflScient occupation
Find life a function to endure.
Finding my youthful dream come true —
Fine ladies, military fops.
Fine tales about your fair young Finn.
First Eugene, still advancing duly.
First Spain was rocked by storm, and, second.
First at the desk, with lamp unlighted.
First glory, and then wealth and rank.
First let us prick his vanity
First snow, and delicately wrote 
First, memory would trace the features,
First: he accused himself of mocking
Five centuries are all we need 
Flames up, the embers glow again 
Fling him currants ripe and red.
Flings wide the door; his caftan’s torn,
Flows down in muddy streams and steady
Fluff in his hair, with visored cap
Fluff up her hair as style commands.
Fly, my darlings, run away.
Foot it neatly on the green!
For (as I’ve said) there he must sit 
For 1808 without a binding:
For Eugene to behold him there 
For God knows whom inspired your soul, 
For Lensky, the cotillion seemed 
For Olga’s album — not a bit!
For Petersburg’s no sleepyhead.
For a few books, a wilderness
For a long time . . . indeed, forever.
For all her future social cares 
For all that musty rhetoric.
For all the efforts she is making.
For all their views and passions not,
For all through Russia there will run 
For all your great gifts and your least, 
For army service; kept the books;
For as it is, my style is peppered
For carefree youth knows no regret.
For dreams, and would have been a shame.
For epigrams it would be splendid . . .
For epigrams, and was annoyed 
For four long years she had been ailing.
For friendship’s sake would I were writing
For glory will be hers, and treasure!”
For gossip is not held a crime.
For happiness. Good God! I see
For he is welcome everywhere.
For here, Napoleon, elated
For him one moral had to teach;
For honor could require no less.
For if they sing, they can’t be eating
For it is late, the shortest way;
For just those little slips of grammar;
For lady never, no, not one.
For learning takes an utter fool.
For marriage bond or marriage bell;
For me? Shall I yet see you winging 
For ravings that it may induce.
For rustic freedom thus delights,
For six weeks yearly be a mess, a 
For such a life, I am afiraid.
For such mere trifles? Why repine 
For the United Slavs recruited.
For the corvee he substituted
For the cotillion begs her hand.
For the first time in any novel
For the good-byes; the turn-out waits. 
For the most costly merchandise 
For the wild steppes’ barbaric tongues,
For there’s a lack of taste in us.
For this new hero prithee feel a
For though the country boasts no palace,
For thus he brings his passion’s fuel
For trousers^ dress-coat^ and for vest;
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
For woman is a tender fool,
For worldly shows and vanities.
For, sad to say, she loved another:
Forbidden fruits alone entice —
Forced me to tear my heart away;
Forget the feelings that held riot
Forgetting friends and city ways
Forgive me, then, for thus retreating. 
Forgive me: Tanya, from the start,
Forgive the tears you wring from me,
Forgotten bridges rot and sink;
Forth rushes greedy youth to capture 
Forward, with groan and grunt he lunges,
Found a white picture to surprise her:
Found nothing fit to fill his life.
Four steps toward a narrow bed.
Framed somberly by gentlemen.
Free from digressions Chapter Five.
Freely the poet spoke and truly,
French choreographer established in Russia.
French dishes for the gourmet’s tooth.
French prelate who was Napoleon’s chaplain; his 
French turns will please me in a sentence
French writer.
Fresh grief would cause a keener smart —
Friends, for the poet you are grieving,
From Eugene: he was far too jaded —
From Istamboul may not be here.
From Kishinev to friends of Greece.
From Northern snows: you loved to tread 
From a moth-eaten almanac;
From all the heart holds dear, my blunder
From distant streets where cabs were flying, 
From early youth his dedication
From head to foot, in form or face.
From here he watched with thoughtful eyes
From hesitancy strove to wean us.
From his affection; they were these:
From hour to hour yet more enraptured
From misty Germany, Vladimir 
From nearby hills the snow, already
From other fires that had been hidden
From our good friends, may Heaven save us!
From porch to court, and shadow-light 
From shipboard looming on the sight
From shipboard, thunder dawn, than I, 
From speech: you never would have learned
From that dull hole . . And his lorgnette
From the drawn bow the arrow leaping
From the hussar, Pykhtin, who used
From their twin lanterns as they go.
From then on he never left the Emperor’s side. In 
From these the man might be inferred.
From thoughts of him she is not firee;
From two to thirty, in a row;
Frost glistens. Mother Winter’s arts
Fruit of spoiled years, or green and tart,
Full soon my errant Muse was proving
GRIBOYEDOV
Games kindred in monotony.
Gave up his dreams as wild and silly:
Gay carriages, a goodly number,
Girls, strike up a melody.
Give way in turn to common sense:
Given to mournful reverie.”
Glass after glass is drained in drenching
Gleam white; the sleigh, more swift than steady. 
Glimpse of Terpsichore’s sweet foot. 
Glimpsing behind the distant bushes 
Go with the solemn folk who bore you.
God’s servant, and a brigadier,
God grant it’s nothing! Welladay!
God grant you find some trifle here
God helped; complaints did not embarrass
Goes out at once, demands a horse.
Goethe and Schiller were his masters.
Gold pines, and live Limburger cheese.
Gone with the styles we do not use,
Good neighbor who’s dropped in on me,
Good readers: a new face arrives.
Graved on the monument you see:
Gravely departed priest and guest.
Gray skies, and heaps of straw in billows
Great by Shirinsky-Shikhmatov and Gruzintzev.
Great ladies, far too proud to fall,
Great ladies, of whom he’d been fond; 
Greek names, as, for example, Agathon, Philat, Theo- 
Green tables are set up, alluring
Grew worldly-wise as life grew chilly,
Griboyedov’s famous comedy, Woe From Wit.
Grieves for the wretch throughout her life,
Grow fond — out of sheer idleness.
Guests bow and scrape within the door.
Guillot is standing, ill at ease.
Gulnare’s bold singer emulating,
Gustave de Linar: a character in Valerie, a novel by 
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
H’m, h’m! dear reader, pray apprise me.
HORACE
HOW CAN ONE NOT LOVE MOSCOW, PRAY?
Had Eugene, from a little bird.
Had been refurbished, yawn he must.
Had brought the fruits of learning’s tree: 
Had chased him and had quickly caught him.
Had gout at forty, fat and flabby;
Had he been quicker in revealing —
Had he but known the wounding sorrow
Had her shy wistful heart been burning; 
Had made the choice, ’twas not her own;
Had marked the place; and, more attentive, 
Had shown to my enchanted glance 
Half-grave, half-gay, and with a flavor 
Hard pavements, like a coat of mail.
Harold.
Has been diluted heavily.
Has clothed a hopeless egoism 
Has found a refuge from the blast 
Has held the first place in my heart.
Has sent you, and I shall be leaning 
Has she the answer to the riddle
Has thrilled by night the silent dale.
Have acted with intelligence.
Have been away! Before you vanish 
Have been content to eat and drink,
Have cards and dice; and not for naught 
Have dimmed the golden coal; half-seen,
Have given me prestige? Be frank!
Have learned how hearts can be tormented.
Have paid to folly what’s her due.
Have passages on nature vying 
Have passed since in a hazy vision 
Have played a prank in coquetry.
Have seen such ladies, not a few
Have there been any conflagrations?
Have they arrived? His calculations
Have your own horses pull your coaches,
Having attained to twenty -six —
Having her album there to finger,
Having, to satisfy a whim.
He’d catch the moment of emotion.
He’d had a glimpse of his estate;
He’d have disarmed the youthful heart.
He’d led a kind and simple life;
He’d stroll into the drawing-room 
He’d suffer bonds again, provided 
He’d suffered j&rom such things for years.
He’d take his fascinating pen 
He’ll then resume till day is breaking
He’s dignified, he dyes his hair.
He’s done with women, and it looks 
He’s driven from the ball to bed:
He’s in, and flying to the mill.
He’s killed! The fearful affirmation
He’s read and read, and pray, what for?
He’s sent to doctors, the Neva’s
He Hked debate, and sometimes rudely
He barely spoke; his urgent mission
He bowed to her without a word.
He calls for help, in misery;
He came, unripe, unto the tomb!
He came. And her eyes opened. Quaking,
He can no longer be enchanted,
He cannot give me happiness.”
He caught the post with eager haste,
He comes upon her, as he enters.
He comes: a cork pops, up it goes.
He could forget himself completely.
He counts the slow hours, vainly trying
He curses women’s whim with force.
He dares to trifle with a tress
He decorates it earnestly:
He did not die or go insane.
He did not know that books could say things
He did not stir, but like one dreaming
He did not value letters much.
He did stop short of suicide.
He died a short hour before dinner.
He dined here. What fine gentlemen!
He dined, he danced, he fenced, he rode.
He does not cease his stubborn stare:
He does not even guess my pain.
He does not heed the mind’s reproaches,
He drinks: with greedy howls they swill;
He dropped his eyes in irritation
He early knew the agitation
He early played the fond deceiver.
He erred; for Eugene, hardy sinner.
He feared that he had not incited
He feels that it must break with grieving. 
He fell from off a Kalmuck stallion.
He finds that no remarks occur
He first abandoned you, capricious
He fled their noisy conversation
He found it puzzling but alluring;
He found the fairest faces null;
He found the matter not too clear.
He frowns, and everyone is still;
He gazes, and his heart is riven:
He gives his man the arms to carry
He goes in to the princess, quaking;
He had no itch to dig for glories
He had some other expectation?
He has a single thought to ponder:
He has it still — a touching note,
He held that loyal friends and steady
He held that some by Fate were chosen
He holds a stocking he was mending;
He hoped that in good time I’d marry
He hows to sundry friends; his mocking
He is the victim of remorse.
He is, though not renowned or quoted,
He joins the throng on the boulevard^
He killed eight years thus like a dunce —
He knew one constant inspiration.
He knew one torment, one delight
He knew the ruses that would brighten
He knew the task would sorely try him
He knows dehght when he’s adjusting
He laughs, and they are all guffawing;
He lay most strangely there at rest.
He lays her down upon the sill.
He leads her, nonchalantly gliding.
He leaves the ladies’ hands unkissed;
He left his rustics to their tillage,
He let the classic laurel fade,
He let the summer season fly,
He listened to young Lensky, smiling:
He lived — in summer rose at seven;
He lived in quite another age);
He looked more crestfallen than regal
He looked the poet, when he’d let a
He looked them over, boxed them right,
He loved as people love no longer
He loved me, and the dawn of life
He loved the dark and shunned the daytime,
He loves you ... as a relative!
He marked the time, and presently
He marks the hour with some dismay:
He may pick up her handkerchief.
He might have altered and deserted
He might have gone to bed and died
He might have learned that life was shabby
He must be off without delay.
He never thought of the vexation 
He noted with accustomed malice.
He now repents him of the course
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
He offered solace and delight,
He offers all a grand example;
He often paid a call, surmising 
He paid the Muses honor due;
He passes over in a rush
He pens, with trembling hand and weak,
He pours out fluent melodies;
He quits his place of hibernation —
He quits the rout, and, meditating.
He racked his brains, and still believed
He read at will: Gibbon, Rousseau,
He read miscellany and journal.
He rescued them, and with the knack
He said, and found his words the cue
He sang life’s bloom and early blight:
He sang of parting and repining;
He sang the rose, romantic flower;
He savors the few words that settle
He scorned most men (not every one).
He seems to see his Olga there
He seems, indeed, an alien here,
He sees forgotten foes, malicious 
He sees the self-willed Terek flinging
He set his mind to work with zest.
He set the ladies’ eyes aglow.
He sighed, no longer subject to them:
He sighs: ^'They’re past the age — it’s shocking! 
He soon consigns them to perdition. 
He spared the rod to spoil the boy,
He spared us, true, one piece of folly;
He swam this Hellespont anew,
He talked about the wealth of nations;
He thought it no great loss — perchance
He thought the tomes his daughter kept
He thought: I must not disconcert him
He thrust his nose in right away.
He took his coffee here, and rested,
He took, and fain would be forgiven;
He trembles, cannot say a word,
He turned a partial eye on it.
He waits with jealous indignation
He waits: and up a troika prances,
He wakes to find a note — that’s pleasant:
He walks into the empty lobby.
He wanted to converse with her
He was a veteran in love.
He was convinced the fickle fair
He was in bliss. Indeed, thrice blessed 
He was no fool; and Eugene, ready
He was none of your poetasters,
He was not one to pick and choose.
He watched her as she played and sang;
He waved his hand, as one who’d rue it
He well knew how to set you laughing.
He who could never understand
He will lie late, and on Ms tray 
He wore a dressing-gown himself;
He would implore the shy confession.
He would not play the base deceiver.
He writes a verse for her to dote on —
He yawns and starts to snore again.
He yawns, for serious labor tries him.
Headlong into a world unknown.
Hear my confession, then, I pray.
Held Richardson as dear as life.
Heloise; Clarissa: the heroine of Clarissa Harlotve; 
Her anguished heart some peace w as granteti
Her billowy soft rugs are flung;
Her cheek rests on her hand, and she
Her chest heaves, and her cheeks are kindled 
Her countrified simplicity 
Her darkening eyes she never raises;
Her dear familiar room shows plain,
Her dove, her confidante devoted,
Her dowdy frocks, and to their mercies 
Her dreams in every circumstance 
Her dreamy mood did not consort
Her eyes betray her with a tear.
Her eyes shine, and her breath has dwindled.
Her face would pale, her body quivered.
Her father saw no harm in reading
Her flaxen hair, her graceful poses.
Her flowers, her romantic novels,
Her fondness for them never changing.
Her gauzy veil aside to see 
Her grief into the garden taking,
Her growing doubts they cannot still.
Her heart assailed, where’er she went 
Her heart was filled with one alone.
Her heart, and when she likes, 'withdraws, 
Her husband, in the corner, dozing,
Her in the princess readily!
Her languor will not let her move.
Her look, so candid and serene.
Her looks, her words — he does not flatter.
Her love in Russian has confided;
Her lowered eyes agleam the while,
Her manner was what it had been
Her melancholy eyes adore him —
Her mind with agitation seething,
Her motion, in pure splendor dressed!
Her nightgown slips from off her shoulder,
Her passion, not by chance or skill; 
Her pet, Rossini, must be heard.
Her prudent husband, to distract her.
Her rosy cheeks are not less bright
Her rosy innocence and grace.
Her sad fatigue, her helpless languor.
Her sister tempts the Muse, not she.
Her sky-blue eyes, her cheeks like roses,
Her small wet slipper’s next to go.
Her son! to distant regions fled,
Her soul was waiting . . . ah, for whom?
Her spouse had not a word to say.
Her sweet simplicity of mien! . . .
Her tender fingers sewed no seam,
Her tender voice is like a reed’s.
Her terror held a secret charm:
Her trailing skirt, with hand that quivers;
Her trinkets rudely from her tearing;
Her virgin calm is of the past;
Her voice, were such as they portray
Her voiceless grief was past disguising;
Her walks are longer, she will dally
Her weakness, and she coughed and cried.
Her well-bound quarto to inscribe,
Her work the crackling matchwood lights,
Her worth, each year more sullen growing. 
Here’s Petushkov, a rural beau;
Here’s Pradt and Scott. You do not think
Here’s bronze and china in profusion.
Here’s every dainty that you please:
Here’s the exordium. That’s that!
Here’s what you find there (am I right?) :
Here’s winter! . . . The triumphant peasant
Here Lunin spoke impressively,
Here Pushkin read his verse with swagger.
Here an ambassador was weighing 
Here at my feet. But dare you say 
Here comes Gvozdin, a first-rate farmer
Here dandies now in the ascendant
Here fashionables would repair.
Here in the world’s benumbing rapture, 
Here in this village unfrequented.
Here is a ball, and there a party;
Here is a door — ^he flings it wide,
Here not a wit was found to shine
Here one heard naught but echoes, dying,
Here the patricians congregated.
Here too the plainsman comes and brags,
Here was Onegin, then, possessing
Here was a man who had a weakness
Here you will find as decoration
Here, bonneted and wearing roses,
Here, mornings, he would read his book . . . 
Hers is a calm simplicity.
Herself to love and all its laws.
Hi Dashed off; arrived; and heartily
Hi Too ill for hopes of getting better,
Hi Yet brighter shines the moon than any
High tragedy and swoons and tears,
Highways to make the country one.
Himself back to his regiment.
Himself so deep in it that he 
Himself transformed into a horse;
Himself, even in privacy.
Himself, his dinner, and his wife.
His Olga. I can hear him say:
His appetite for pleasure’s hearty —
His bride was soon content to be 
His course no more; but, oh, most dear,
His courting now was minus zest;
His cup of tea with rum deserting,
His debt to nature has been paid.
His door he locks, his lamp he trims.
His doubts were never past the curing,
His doubts: for meet they surely will 
His dressing-gown and slippers bringing,
His drowsy eyes, and draws aside 
His early years were all a waste.
His enemies were always base.
His epitaph is plain as he;
His eyes, how tender, quick and clear.
His father listened, frowned, and groaned.
His friend [Kaverin] must be waiting.
His friend for thus misleading him;
His friend unburdened himself of —
His gentle touch nowise dismays her.
His hair cut in the latest mode;
His hand upon his breast lays lightly.
His head above her fondly bent,
His heart is all but crushed with pain,
His heart is by such anguish bitten
His heart leaps up, his soul is stirred.
His heart the nest of fond illusion,
His heart was pure, his conscience clear;
His heart with sore repentance filled.
His housekeeper for forty years,
His illness — ^name it how you choose,
His jealousy and his vexation
His knowledge of the tongue was slight:
His life, that knew no cares or labors,
His madness — and again immerses 
His magic presence hovers round her;
His mare scents snow upon the pleasant
His mind was ever far away;
His mood no gloomier, no gayer;
His mother stands and threatens him.
His music therewith sweetly c h im i ng;
His nag has ribs that might be counted. 
His neighbor, calling out his name,
His news sets girlish hearts to drumming:
His nineteenth year was scarce in sight.
His oars above the drowsy stream;
His object was emancipation.
His page is empty as can be.
His passing came as a disaster
His pocket burns: it holds a treasure,
His precious Olga: such is love!
His principal accomplishment;
His roans bring Lensky to the door;
His sentiments were fine and true.
His sharp intelligence and chilly,
His slightest move is overawing;
His son was married recently.
His son, Lieutenant General I. A. Annibal, was
His soul’s innate nobility;
His soul by highest motives guided,
His spirit knew their lyric jSre.
His stables, forests, streams and land.
His strain was languid, dark (romantic
His toast rings out the first of all,
His uncle’s in his cofl&n laid:
His verses like a river flow.
His virgin lyric was of her.
His was the love of poets, stronger 
His way of dreaming, willy-nilly.
His wedding was a settled matter.
His were the dreams that move the heart
His whims; 0 hover thou above 
His worn shoe slipping on the ice,
Hither to our frolic and 
Hold on, old fellow, that will do . . .
Hold your lorgnette up, watch them nearly.
Holding their pious habits dear;
Homeward, along the kitchen-garden;
Hope lies to them, and they’re beguiled.
Hope of a name none might forget.
Hoping her grief might thus abate;
Hoping to sell his worthless nags;
Horns and a quilted dressing-gown;
How ardently this breast was burning! 
How blessed the lover who is granted
How blessed, indeed . . . though she might choose
How can I help you, only say!
How changed Tatyana is! How truly
How dismal to be sturdy. Lord,
How dismal to be young, and bored!”
How dismal!
How heavenly, as she advances,
How is it that you do not fall 
How jfirmly her attention centers
How justly now I am afflicted.
How many chapters Fate has closed! 
How many follies then were floating
How many swiftly flitting days 
How much of life I spent in vain.
How noble was the tone he’d taken;
How oft on the dark shores of Tauris
How often, sick with separation,
How once I held her stirrup for her,
How sad I find you! How you flood 
How sad it is to be forgetting!
How very welcome you will be.”
However dazzling to the sight.
However, was no Grandison.
Husbands esteemed, to you I tender —
Hymen prepares to strew our way,
I’d bring you nothing but distress.
I’d give my house and all that’s in it.
I’d like to see with my own eyes
I’d live through every ball again.
I’ll bring them to the altar then . . .
I’ll give the censorship its due.
I’ll go!” And he does not defer
I’ll have a duel with my friend.
I’ll not debate the point. Ye gods!
I’ll sprinkle you with holy water.
I’ll tell no ghostly tales, or gory.
I’m bored; tell me a story, dear.”
I’m sad and cold, and yet it seems 
I’ve a suspicion, make me ill.
I’ve always thought well suited to 
I’ve drawn a likeness perfectly:
I’ve fallen on black days, my dear —
I’ve finished cantos nine, no more;
I’ve haunted the ballet — what for?
I’ve married off my younger daughter,
I’ve scanned the pages most severely.
I . . . I’m in love,” she murmured low.
I And you, small fruit of eager labor:
I He’d greet the hour so long awaited.
I The taw^dry glitter of her vesture.
I am assailed by melancholy;
I am deceived by no illusion;
I am not given to repentance —
I blame you . . . For you acted boldly. 
I bow and cede my rights to you . . .
I boxed your ears! I gave you cakes!”
I burned, my pulses started drumming.
I call on freedom — ^naught avails:
I called Odessa dusty —
I can’t go out: I cannot walk —
I cannot say; I’ve talked so long
I cannot suffer the discussion —
I choke him with a tragedy;
I could not see it without gloating,
I court the Muse with indolence.
I did not ache with such desire
I drag myself about; timers hasting.
I fain would write a diatribe —
I fear lest in my supplication
I fear, friends, lest your patience fail:
I find the plain home circle dear.
I first resolved upon refraining
I first saw young Tatyana glide 
I found you good, and I attest 
I freeze — good God! — ^recalling how
I frighten the wild ducks by rolling
I hardly read, I’m often dozing.
I hate red lips that are unsmiling,
I have known women, stern and rigid.
I have no care for flighty fame;
I have no faith in its requiting
I have no tears, in spite of grief;
I have seen other belles who bent
I have them here for you to see:
I hear the magic of your voice,
I heard her friendly accents soften;
I know that life is but a bubble,
I know there’ll be a warm reception
I know your heart; I need not tremble.
I left you in a dreadful fright;
I like a life of country quiet;
I liked, and his peculiar pose;
I listened, not without elation.
I looked for peace in prayer, kneeling.
I lose the thread, my mind’s not clear.
I love fierce youth, my private passion
I love you (why should I dissemble?)
I loved your image even then;
I loved, and nothing could relieve me. 
I married. Now, I beg you, go.
I marveled at their iron virtue,
I might (who knows?) have grown contented.
I might indeed make bold to borrow
I moved there also for a while,
I must admit the sorry truth,
I must be certain in the morning
I must be growing dull, I fear.
I must say candid words or none.
I pace the beach, await good weather.
I quote myself, and do it pat).
I read a shy, confiding word.
I read not to the crowd, but only
I reminisced of the attraction
I sadly call on each sweet name.
I say: give up a style outmoded.
I see the pain has left no trace;
I shall be true to him through life.”
I shall defy the dread ApoUo,
I shall lose patience soon, of course:
I shall not suffer the deceiver
I shall recall the tongue of longing.
I share the scalding tears you drop:
I strolled into the farmyard — faugh!
I take a stroll. Now cups are clinking
I take my leave of you — farewell.
I tasted all your joys with zest;
I thank you from my inmost soul . . .
I thought to paint (see Chapter One)
I throw myself on your compassion . . .
I too had dropped, and found him then — 
I took this peace, this liberty.
I treasure it most piously;
I trembled at your glance, and when
I trust that you will pardon me;
I try to glimpse it; but I trust 
I understood them not at all.
I vurite you, and my act is serving
I w-ould not praise you, but sincerely
I w-ould requite sincerity;
I wait: when once your look has spoken.
I want my peace, my pot of stchi.
I want to cry, to sob — oh, nursey!”
I was a dolt and could not sing.
I was embittered, he morose.
I was in too much haste, I fear;
I was not bom for happiness;
I watched her spouse, with time to spare;
I would not leave the world, unknown.
I would prefer your harsh cold fashion
I write, and longing is diminished;
I, too, recalling poor Svetlana,
III As she reviews Onegin’s coming
III For verse — it would not be surprising,
III He lived in debt, and did not bother
III Killed flies, and snugly rusticated.
III Mourn those that autumn doomed to perish.
IV And melancholy minus reason.
IV And reader, you are not refusing
IV And you who bask in fortune’s favor.
IV Five versts away from Krasnogorye,
IV How often, by her tales diverted
IV Of making certain grand concessions
IV She loved the Russian winter season

If for a moment I found pleasure
If friends and kin are undeserving.
If he goes home, his dreams still linger
If not, my dear. I’ll see you through.”
If on the left she would espy
If only you were with me still,
If out of date, the lofty ceiling.
If she encountered, unaware,
If there had been a hope remaining
If there w'as carping comment, too;
If true delight you would afford him
If you but knew how agonizing
If you have any mind to flirt, you
If you recall your Tanya still,
Ignores what happened yesterday,
Ilya, the cautious, prone to balk.
Imagine: here I am alone.
Immersed in it the houses founder;
Impatient, twitch beneath the lamp.
Important folk, and is it true 
Impulsiveness may lead to grief.”
In 1812 ? The folk’s resistance,
In French he could converse politely.
In Olga’s presence poor Vladimir
In Orient luxury once cherished.
In Richardson as in Rousseau.
In Russia, where for lack of historical memoirs,
In Russian? And the task’s infernal. 
In Say and Bentham for her chatter. 
In all the novels of the day.
In any small degree betrayed her:
In billiards, with a good blunt cue 
In cantos numbering twenty -five!
In catching Tanya’s eye, she took 
In chorus the old ladies cry:
In colored silks a pattern fit 
In cosy comfort, sleeping sweetly.
In cosy scenes of fireside life.
In deep reflection, hot discussion.
In dizzy circles round and round, 
In dread of what this might forebode;
In dress a pedant and a fop.
In dust . . . But there the skies are bright; 
In elegiac mood, at last 
In endless reverie indulging,
In every nook, with strange emotion;
In fancying a happy tryst 
In festive crowds, in solitude.
In flannels and a night-cap too.
In full the tender story duly,
In gentle whispers with her nurse.
In golden languor vaguely floating;
In gossip finds the spice of life,
In grave seclusion as is fit.
In hacked as well as hackneyed verse 
In her room w"hile the light is flitting;
In his first youth he w'as the prey
In ink or colors he is sketching
In its seductive figments now!
In judgment on himself could be 
In kerchief and long gown of wool.
In many guises she comes flying:
In mind: that if I had my will,
In mischief, but horrific stories 
In nothing, but can never rest.
In our lime too, in days of old),
In our poetic reverie
In passing that my stanzas speak 
In praise of so much wit and charm.
In praises of his hardihood;
In reverie they would dissolve;
In runs his valet, prompt Guillot,
In saturnine romanticism.
In secret Tanya was repining;
In secret, of dear distant creatures.
In short, and I was proud of her.
In shouting fiercely: ^^Mine! She’s mine!”
In silence, hearing still the faint
In solitude without a flaw,
In soul, of all the guests the least 
In spite of all oinr efforts, too.
In still and somber beauty stand
In such a brief and tragic fashion —
In such a year, at such an age;
In talk of love. It was thought shameless — 
In that same hamlet where of yore 
In that swift moment one could see
In the dark hours ere Morpheus, flying,
In the mazurka, ’twas allowed.
In the same carefree lively way 
In the smart sanctum, all a -quiver,
In the soft luxury of feeling,
In the steep shade a camel lying;
In the thick grass where none can see,
In the unruj63ed heavens shining;
In this affair our friend was tested
In this case it is not too strong
In this important sport the jaded
In this opinion all concur.
In those white hands would be distressing! 
In time I shall relate the rest.
In time, my readers, you shall hear
In time-worn halls and those that just
In to her sister, swallow-light;
In token of our warm regard.
In torment at your feet to swoon —
In town), with pots and pans and gear 
In tracking you! I should be moving 
In triumph at the joyous shore;
In truth what brought you here today? 
In turn Ms fickle flattery brings.
In uniform . . . Now he is walking 
In vain a Moscow on her knees 
In vain into the darkness staring
In vain she struggles to escape;
In vain the belles might clamor for him.
In which, God help us, we are stuck.
In winter when the nights were wild.
In winter, when night’s shade encloses
In worldly dazzle and confusion
In your imported carriage, pray
In youth, were such the joys I’d count on?
Inane and petty, while the ode
Increase the din of celebration;
Indeed what can I hope for ^ after
Indeed, he soon received a letter
Indeed, you played a noble role:
Indoors, the maid will softly sing
Indulge in lovers’ dreams with ease;
Infer, then, with what thorny roses
Inflames the girl’s conceited face;
Inscribing albums of this kind:
Inscription written: ”Ye surrender 
Inserting: belle Tatiana.
Inspired Mickiewicz used to stand 
Inspired by tender melancholy,
Instead of bristling at the start —
Instruct the fair without a word.
Into a meadow sweet with bloom.
Into a more exacting book.
Into one image, her heart leaping 
Into the flooded meadowlands.
Into the pan the powder’s sifted,
Into the silent study, setting
Into the stream her red-webbed foot,
Into the woods, pursued, she presses;
Invite her, kiss her, press her hands.
Is Eugene! By another portal 
Is alien to my breast, and brings
Is all abubble and agleam,
Is all they give us as a rule,
Is bound up with the servants’ hall.
Is brought, and Dunya pours his tea;
Is but a flirt. Though she is barely 
Is but the wistful moon’s, alas! . , «
Is but to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
Is dashing in the cab he hired.
Is dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
Is for the good old-fashioned ways.
Is forced to curtsey, to his bow.
Is gaily whirling overhead,
Is half a crane and half a cat.
Is he bewitched? It’s very droll.
Is he from Heaven or from Hades?
Is heedless of the friendly clapping;
Is honor’s mainspring. I’ll be bound —
Is hushed. Alone the angry chorus
Is in these parlous days unknown;
Is it because her love is artless.
Is it because intelligence
Is it because she cannot deem
Is it because we like to sit
Is it that I was born to languish.
Is it the music’s fascination
Is just as deaf and just as meek.
Is launched into eternity.
Is like Van Dyck’s Madonna. Fie!
Is like a copy pale and vicious,
Is lost to us, and he shall never 
Is more than could have been expected:
Is now our hero’s, it appears.
Is slobbered over bit and traces.
Is snatched away from her by Fate
Is southern winter’s travesty;
Is surrogate for happiness.
Is the benign and silent moon;
Is the shrewd elegance of fashion,
Is there a sign of tears? No trace! 
Is this world shut for aye to him?
Is trained on her whose features dimly 
Is weeping, weeping quietly.
Istomina on lifted toe.
It’s frowned on in society.
It’s late. Odessa sleeps, unruffled;
It’s like a mistress, gay, capricious,
It’s maddening to see before you
It’s misery, and who can cure it?”
It’s over. Having supped, the gentry 
It’s plain that here he is the master.
It’s time he ceased to be a show . .
It all pours forth from lips that tremble
It all, in detail, never fear.
It causes frenzy, aberrations.
It gave the tyrant it deserted
It happened that a peddler tendered
It humbly asks romantic fame.
It is a phantom you are chasing,
It is my letter, don’t you see.
It is no wonder I am fretting . .
It is to parch with hot desire^
It makes no difference to her.
It may be Lethe will not cover;
It may be, in your glory flourished.
It may not be: without relief,
It means the people to whose faces
It seemed so, but . . .
It suits my Muse as it suits me.
It waited on, for him alone;
It was decreed ... the will of Heaven
It was for you that I neglected
It was he came to visit me.
It was his pleasure quietly
It was today I met the beauty;
It wrong to scorn when pride commanded —
Its aim is high, its meaning mighty . .
Its classic grace draws in its wake
Its fateful harassments indeed
Its love or anger, grief or joy;
Its parti-colored pageantry.
Its passage, it has ceased to be.
Its pleasures, like the city’s, pall.
Its reckless growth: into the grave 
Its splendor among ancient trees,
Its tale of humble lives, where now 
Its waves on shores that rise up sheer;
Its wings with crazy motions twirling;
Itself upon its memories.
Iv But it is time I was returning
Iv There fancies bloom and dreams run riot —
Ivan Petrovich ne’er was keen,
Ivi With pleasure I have often noted
Ivii I too made it my occupation
Iviii To whom did your confessed devotion.
JA MORALE EST DANS LA NATURE DES CHOSES.
Julie, Clarissa, or Delphine;
Just as the social rites demanded.
Just as the stars had left off dancing.
Just fancy who appears from under!
Just for a dash of lemon waiting.
Just for the sake of being heard.
Just grown-up mischief-makers’ games.
Just here and there hard labor lately
Just now a walk w’ould suit me best.
Just now our roads are bad for coaches;
Just now, did I not see you flitting
Just think, this joy, I can’t endure it.
Just to enjoy the obsequies.

Lamenting in new songs and dirges 
Late nights, yes, and a facile art;
Lay hid in all the prose they uttered —
Lays claim to the young girl’s attention; 
Leading his offspring, Kharlikov;
Leaps for a knife, and Lensky falls;
Led me to church. I had to go.
Left of the village where the poet
Lensky can scarcely trust his eyes.
Lensky was thought an eligible,
Lest the young lady should be hurt.
Lest they should miss us beyond reason
Lest, sick of pleasure, momently
Let’s call some time. Take my advice;
Let alone grief ... I have no strength . . .
Let critics carp, he will not grovel:
Let critics wreak their indignation
Let him believe in wonders still
Let me look back. Farewell, then, bowers
Let no sly reader be so daring —
Let not the poet’s heart know capture
Let the sonorous stanzas roll;
Lies in your hands, for you to fashion;
Lies spread the famous annual fair.
Life’s vista gleams before it yet.
Life was a riddle he would solve.
Light nothings, spoken without guile 
Light quit-rent, and the slave, well suited
Like Byron, pride’s consummate poet;
Like Delwig drunk in company.
Like Hippocrene it sparkles brightly.
Like Petrarch, he finds love less cruel. 
Like Venus’ very self emerging.
Like a Bacchante at the revels.
Like a poor sot to shelter reeling
Like any illness: spleen, or plague;
Like bees that from the hive are pouring 
Like fellowship, as I regale 
Like fevers it can burn and freeze us.
Like fire, the gilded crosses rise 
Like giddy youth forever swirling
Like leaves that in wet autumn stray. 
Like madness make us wild and vague;
Like pale Lenore, by moonlight she
Like prisoners released in sleep
Like secret promenades in sleighs;
Like silver dust the snowflakes lie.
Like smoke across the azure drifted;
Like this decrepit publican?
Like this since first the world began;
Like those whom an old feud inflames.
Like to the moon in lonely pride.

Lions on gates with great stone jaws,
Liqueurs, a ledger, applejack,
Lives there a poet who rehearses
Living the chapters through, she’d glory
Lo! the opinion of the rabble
Long evening pass, while he would sit 
Long hours, the melodies I mend,
Long live Bordeaux, the faithful friend!
Long since her dreams had set her yearning
Long since with sweet disquietude
Long since, but notice if you please 
Long years, maybe, a sudden spark . . .
Look back she dare not; fear would blind her;
Looking too corpselike to be nobby.
Looks backward; lightning-like she rushes 
Looks round: the bear is gone, at least; 
Lord Byron’s tales, which well consorted
Lord help us, friends! To be accursed
Lorgnette in hand, our friend would wander,
Lost like a muted sound and vanished.

Love your own self and so have done!
Loves elbow-room and thrusts us hence?
Low cunning must assist devotion

Malvine — because the set was broken 
Mammas and aunts who pry and peer.
Many a distant love-affair —
Mashuk, most health-giving of mountains;
May Heaven blast your page, amen!
May his soul now be with the blest.
May pass me by or pierce me through;
May pay attention to his nails;
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
May wear the laurel -crown of fame,
Mayhap he would have been reputed.
Mayhap the lyre so early muted
Me if you must: I can’t translate.
Means labor fit to break the back . . .
Meanwhile, forget all toil and trouble,
Meanwhile, in morning costume, gaily
Meanwhile, the moon her silver duty
Men’s malice and the stroke of Fate.

Might dash away as they were nearing.
Might have united them anew!
Mile-posts rejoice the idle eye,

Monsieur Finemouche, friend of the house,

More horrors: here a lobster riding
More lingeringly half the world.
More often now the sun was clouded;
More than a brother’s love for you.
Moscow: those syllables can start
Most blessed is he who never knew them.
Most fearful and most wonderful!
Most harshly: there was no disguising
Move plates and chairs with ready glee,
Much to enchant his virgin mind.
Must breathe no word, must never mention
Must in this matter be your guide.
Must leave my hero, ruefully,
Mute anger only marks her face . . .
Mute, motionless, and cherub -faced;
My Eugene through the winter tarried.
My Eugene was [Chadayev] second:
My Grandison? Oh, Grandison!
My Lensky’s fury grows apace;
My Moscow offered Bonaparte —
My Muse to a superb soiree;
My brainless pupil almost learned
My childish dreams, my tender years,
My conscience speaks — ^pray let me finish;
My country, and an exile’s lot —
My cousin, sleepy-eyed Buyanov,
My days are counted: Fve had warning;
My dear, is an important matter:
My dear, when old age comes at length
My earnest counsels prithee heed.
My fair Russian Terpsichore?
My flighty friend made quite a stir.
My fondness for it is but slight;
My friends. Perhaps, by heaven’s decree,
My frivolous and merry youth!
My girlish dreams forever stilled.
My goddesses! How shall I trace you?
My handsome house and my soirees —
My heart to one, and one alone!
My heart will as of old be shaken.
My high-flown fancies have departed.
My husband’s folk . . . But do you hear?”
My labors — bless them with thy beauty^
My labors, yet perhaps this name 
My legs betray me . . . But it’s tiring
My letter to Onegin.” ”Bless me,
My lips were envious of their blisses!
My little book. With you I knew
My little nook do not forsake;
My lively cousin now advancing.
My love, first warm, would soon diminish, 
My meaning? Nothing. Aly intention
My mother coaxed and wept; the sequel
My mother-in-law would have raged.”
My mournful secret you will shun me:
My name . . .” ^'^Yes, but to whom, my dear?
My poet friends, inclined to stammer
My poor nurse sleeps beneath the bough . . .
My restless thoughts, and I must perish. 
My services in time of need:
My soul’s fair crystal, what surpasses
My soul with dreams that challenge reason. 
My stanza, saved by jealous fate,
My story out, and it is wrong 
My stricken heart cries out and fails me
My student cell grew bright with treasures
My style and my affairs improving.
My thanks for all the hours of gladness,
My thanks, friend, you will not refuse.
My thanks. Alike in peace and riot 
My thoughts in exile turned to you,
My tuneful stanzas forth till they 
My words may move some unborn lover;
My worthy friend. Monsieur Guillot.
My youth fled by, remembrance clings.
My youth in slothful sweet content?
Myself mistaken, did not dare 
N'est-ce pas, for all we want of talk? 
NASCE UNA GENTE A CUI L’MORIR NON DOLE.
NECKER
Napoleon.
Nay, she must hate her brother’s slayer.
Near by (when springtime rains have peppered
Near by, she saw the mansion standing.
Neva, but in those warmer climes 
Neva, oh, offspring of my pen.
Never shall I my soul renew . . .
New leaves for those the tempests scatter. 
New sorrows come, my heart to fret;
New warmth has melted winter’s chain; 
Next day before the sun was high.
Night falls; the moon, already riding
Nikita, restless, keen for glory,
No bard was keen as I to follow
No breath disturbs the warm still night.
No card-game, poetry, or ball.
No coarse mot of a witty snob.
No fancy of a worldly mob.
No feast, no gift to warm his heart:
No finer, but just finicky.
No gift but weariness and anguish 
No grace, no flash of merriment.
No longer fearful of disaster.
No look, no tremor, not a word
No matter— ah, but look with favor
No matter. Why should we be asking
No matter: lisping like a child,
No more I find it quite so pressing
No more a reason for emotion,
No more can hoyden rhymes detain me,
No more my Eugene could discern . . .
No more the casual pen is led 
No more the vogue, you will allow.
No other entertainment needing.
No partner ever was so sprightly.
No punishment is equal to it.
No respite to his heart is granted —
No rival in the girl’s affection . , .
No rung would suit him but the top —
No savoir vivre^ no hint of verse;
No shadow could be faithfuUer.
No single sound escapes from her;
No smart conceits does Lensky fashion
No sooner did the cannon, sounding
No sound, save for the soft slow roar
No syllable of sentiment.
No witty thought occurs, no word
No, passion never wrought for me
No, silent, wild, and melancholy,
No, soon the world began to bore him.
No, to he with you constantly;
No, when with youth and love on fire,
Noise, chatter, on the table shine
None was so quick as he at trapping
Nor bends to fashion’s tyrannies:
Nor calls them, noons, for mustering;
Nor cards, nor gossip, chased his gloom; 
Nor distance, changed his earnest mood
Nor eases tears too long suppressed.
Nor from his greedy lips withdraws 
Nor full of idle chat and silly;
Nor noisy games, nor foreign beauties.
Nor read the ending of the story.
Nor reckoned days as they went by,
Nor shown a fighter’s predilection.
Nor soothes the ache within her breast.
Nor studies such as pedants choose,
Nor was she found with head inclining
Nor yet the cuckold, stout and haughty.
Nor yet were her soft lips compressed.
Nor, from the loge and the parterre,
Not aiming yet, advance four paces.
Not all Onegin’s observation
Not deep or learned or intense.
Not far from Bonaparte’s tent.
Not for you our songs are sung.
Not hesitating to awake him.
Not hours when he fulfilled the duties
Not knowing in the morning where
Not knowing you, I would not thus
Not like a cool coquette w^ho tenders
Not long the Larin house was waking
Not now. I love my hero truly.
Not now: we, like the ladies, proudly
Not only did she fail to shiver.
Not pain, but death. Thus, sparkling whitely
Not so his calculating neighbor
Not thus have sought to cut a dash.
Not what you have, but what you see 
Not with a notion of delighting 
Notes here. Those not marked ^'Pushkin” have been added
Nothing attracted his attention.
Now I am at your mercy, guided
Now Lovelace’s renown is faded.
Now Olga sits before it, filling
Now Yule-tide brings its fun and folly.
Now cut the ice with scraping noise;
Now different scenes delight my senses:
Now five steps more the pair have made.
Now from the dish where they are lying
Now from the shed at crack of dawn
Now having given due attention
Now in his study he bethought him
Now met his spouse. The princess gazed 
Now my Onegin, keen as brandy.
Now my companions are inquiring:
Now nearer! Galloping . . . and here 
Now on what flowers are they set?
Now serpentine she twists and wheels,
Now sleeps the scion of delight.
Now soothed by this anticipation.
Now southward swept the caravan
Now stirred? Is it vexation moving 
Now the mazurka’s strains are sounding.
Now through the open meadow faring,
Now with what eager concentration
Now" let me speak of something jolly.
O’er Petersburg’s dark pavements borne 
O’er her embroidery, designing 
O’ergrown. No wreath hangs on the bough; 
OH, YES, what’s FAR AWAY, THAT WE PREFER!
ONEGIN’S LETTER
ONEGIN TRAVELS TO ASTRAKHAN,
Obeying folly’s least suggestion,
Obeying the spring sun’s commands,
Obeys her feelings sans demur?
Oblige me! Is it such hard labor?”
Oblivion is waiting for us
Observe his closet well, and gage
Observe it with a yawn at last,
Observed the girl’s embarrassed air.
Obtaining, with himself to thank.
Odessa was my home then, shrouded
Of Cleopatra, but whose features.
Of Kamenka’s deep groves and hilly 
Of Lensky’s troth there was no chatter:
Of Lovelace or of Grandison,
Of Moscow beaus and Moscow Circes!
Of Olga’s looks alive to me.
Of Sundays, putting on his glasses,
Of a most tyrannous young fop.
Of all sorts; finally you hear 
Of all the dreams the heart can hold.
Of any nonsense I set down,
Of comme il faut — Shishkov, berate 
Of corks, with much the same attention 
Of course you’ve often seen that treasure.
Of course young Lensky felt no yearning
Of course, one should reward his gabble
Of curses: he’s gone home to change.
Of days long past, when he had been
Of destiny and its defiance.
Of distance, promising delight;
Of elegies at some far date 
Of fables, and a grammar too.
Of feasts and sundry foods and eke 
Of finding worn-out prejudices.
Of fools, and slyly whispered quips ...”
Of good and evil, and of science,
Of heels the stout parquet would quake,
Of heirs is heard, indecently 
Of her companions in the blue.
Of her demure provincial ways,
Of her own heart’s shy hopes and fears;
Of her researches quite forgets
Of high desires and deep regret,
Of him had filled his simple youth,
Of his old uncle’s illness heard?
Of idle youth that no one blames,
Of innocent felicity.
Of intimacies of the past.
Of jdowers, for our modest dwelling.
Of jealous pangs, and separation,
Of letters running to six pages.
Of life’s gay feast ere time is up,
Of life has perished like a flower 
Of loud farewells and crying maids;
Of lovely lady, modish sir.
Of loves that to the grave endure;
Of making such a choice, I know;
Of memory, or welcome rest,
Of my young friend I sing, and of
Of old the ballroom used to shake 
Of park and palace, dome and spire,
Of plates and silverware increases,
Of prejudice’s ancient yoke,
Of prudence now I drink Bordeaux.
Of quiet summer nights, how often,
Of seeing you by afternoon . . . .
Of seething hopes and giddy play,
Of silence he had lain at rest
Of snow, and wash her face and chest.
Of some attractive little thing.
Of some imported wild romance. 
Of speech to this insulting passion.
Of speech, and earn the mockery 
Of speech? For what malicious laughter 
Of such a manner, I’m pedantic.
Of syllables so musical 
Of that dread mystery, the grave;
Of that lost hour beneath the tree 
Of the Black Sea upon the shore.
Of the magnificent Neva.
Of the wild geese, a noisy clan;
Of this and that, to his distress;
Of this cold world, his soul would bless 
Of those he wished her to forget!
Of tulle she wore in other days;
Of welcome are indeed heart-rending.
Of what is common, what is grand;
Of what, in fashionable diction
Of which I’ve lost the habit now.
Of which Onegin never tired.
Of whom ’twas said throughout his span:
Of wintry pleasures; you will dote 
Of worldly scorn, and thus are fed.
Of youth renewed beside these streams.
Of youthful pranks and childish pleasures, 
Off in a narrow lane, at last.
Off in the cotmtry we can say
Off in the wilds — ^is it not true? — 
Off to the ball as is required,
Off to the country promptly packed her,
Offended vanity or spleen?
Oh, Brenta! I shall yet rejoice
Oh, I have erred sufficiently
Oh, Moscow, Moscow! I would view
Oh, empty world! Oh, stupid folk
Oh, horror! Better far to stay
Oh, humans, like your first mamma.
Oh, land of boundless fascination!
Oh, once again will you be singing
Oh, waters of the Adriatic!
Oh, yes. But there’s the whirl of fashion.
Old W’omen, boys with cheeks like cherries,
Old duelist can be malicious:
Old fogies all, chained to tradition,
Old monkeys of another age 
Old women smiled as she went by;
Old-fashioned hospitality.
Olenka too began to yawn,
Ombre and Boston claim the old,
On Apuleius gladly nourished.
On all but him! She never sees 
On balls I also used to dote:
On down to where the river flows.
On elegance her mind w^as bent.
On every single suitor’s hopes?
On everything and everyone:
On foreign scenes to feast our eyes;
On hearing this, Zaretzky started
On her loose hair, her tears, and on 
On horseback; such close friends were they 
On other paths, since youth is spent,
On past the bright parterre, the lawn.
On plucking the two-headed eagle 
On scenes both various and motley.
On sentiment we draw the curtain;
On stilts the bold pedestrian
On the bleak steppe go horseback-riding?
On the far bank the smoky fire
On the first page there’s this confection:
On the streaked ice the sunbeams play;
On themes to which none now alludes,
On through the field the girl will ride, 
On us the favors that men crave;
On whom shall we bestow affection,
On writing of another man.
On your protection till I die . . .
Once Vyazemsky sat down beside her
Once dwelt, two pines are intertwined —
Once free, and night will find me gloating
Once graced the devil’s own abode,
Once lechery that took its pleasure
Once more Tatyana’s heart is drumming;
Once more forsakes society.
One cherished fancy for another
One clownish fellow, idly leaning
One day when leading his battalion.
One finger’s frostbitten, of course.
One foot upon the floor is planted.
One has a cock’s head plain to see,
One heard the crickets’ slender choir.
One hears the clicking of a cock.
One is a horned and dog-faced creature,
One line, held in the memory.
One saw the cheerful morning smile;
One takes a risk in such discussion,
One thing alone he loved, he breathed;
One thing alone to think upon 
One thought must fill your heart with pain:
One who has lived and thought, grows scornful.
One whose embittered mind finds zest
One whose warm kindness has no end —
One window glimmers bright and rosy.
Onegin’s form, Onegin’s face.
Onegin’s holy life; unheeding,
Onegin’s letter A trick worthy of detestation;
Onegin’s portrait has been finished,
Onegin’s taste for books had vanished
Onegin’s traits with mine comparing —
Onegin’s waiting for us now.”
Onegin (I return to him).
Onegin a pure rapture felt.
Onegin comes, apologizing.
Onegin fires . . . oh, hapless men.
Onegin flies to taste the blisses
Onegin fumbles as he seeks 
Onegin grips his pistol tightly,
Onegin heard the sweet confession
Onegin leaned above the river
Onegin now decides he’ll cater
Onegin searched the cupboards, finding
Onegin sits and drinks a health,
Onegin sleeps and does not worry.
Onegin the cotillion. Lord!
Onegin too. '"^At last, oh, dear!”
Onegin took the letter to
Onegin turned to Lensky next:
Onegin was allowed to hear 
Onegin watches her, congealed:
Onegin without hesitating
Onegin, also far away.
Onegin, and I loved you; well? 
Onegin, but she seems to freeze 
Onegin, frozen with despair.
Onegin, like Childe Harold, scorning
Onegin, meet him, born and nourished
Onegin, need I ask you whether
Onegin, that familiar place.
Onegin, what shrewd line expressed 
Onegin, wiseacres aplenty

Orestes vied there with his friend,
Oton is so accommodating.
Our Czar was dozing . . .
Our Lensky’s village, lives and thrives,
Our dapper coachmen are astounding,
Our freshest dreams grew sear, and scattered 
Our grandchildren evict us too.
Our hero took the marble stair,
Our hero, lived not so long since.
Our marriage w-ould mean misery.
Our native tongue turns up its nose
Our northern summer, swiftly flying,
Our songs, but are not worth the singing. 
Our sorrows and our smaller cares,
Our talkative young eremites;
Our time will come when it is due,
Our troikas tireless, forward bounding.

Poor Lensky cannot bear his sorrow.
Poor Lensky fell . . . that luckless day.
Poor Lensky scarce knew what to say.
Poor Lensky! Olga’s heart was laden
Poor Lensky! Past the grave’s grim portal.
Poor Tanya’s youth is fading fast,

Recall Dmitriyev’s castigation;

Recovered, Tanya, pale and shrinking,
Refuse to let you sleep a wink;

Sacred to scions of Apollo!
Sad murmur of the soul’s complaint.
Sad murmurs filled the woodland ways
Safe in the woodland, hid away.

Save for the chorus on the hill
Say who it is that now the Spanish 
Say, from a bullet-wound? Or failing.
Say, now, my friend, what will you feel
Says ’yes’ and ’no,’ but never ’sir.’ ”
Says Tanya, ^'Nay, I am not grumbling:
Scarce breathing, making no replies,

Secure a tryst with tender art,

Seduce you, though the cost be frightful. 
Seduction ceased to be amusing,
Seeing the molten wax assume

Seemed sunk in gloom, or bold and free.
Self-centered and indifferent.

Shall I depict less with a prudent
Shall greet you. Go, my dear creation:

She’d watch its flight with anxious eye.
She’s at the window — always she! . . .
She’s wearing raspberry.” "Yes, you
She asks: ”The left? What’s there to see?”
She at a table took her place
She bade me hear the waters sing,
She breathes again and yet again,
She can no more, her strength is gone*
She cannot. No? But why? She’s given
She chides the waters that impede her^
She clambered up a hill, commanding
She conned the talk against her will;
She could but peak and pine and weep,
She cries: ^'Whom, Tanya, did you see?”
She dare not lift, for shame and fear.
She did not speak the language well
She did the overseeing; cool
She does not argue: by delaying
She does not breathe, she does not stir;
She does not heed: and sore it grieves him
She does not raise him, leaves him kneeling;
She does not sniff the cold, or run
She dreams. And wonders are appearing
She drops her handkerchief, and shivers,
She falls . . .
She falls into the snow; alertly
She fancied ghosts behind her stalking.
She fears the dream bodes only ill.
She finds; abyss, ape, bear, bridge, cave,
She flies, a thing of down, enchanted;
She flies, she flies, nor in her flight 
She followed, as he did, the fashion;
She found in a romantic story
She found the margins most appealing:
She gazes at him without pause . . .
She glances at the road, distressed.
She glides; and now serenely stops,
She had not read with fascination
She halted at the gate-way, telling
She halted, like one scorched by fire. 
She has no aim, no occupation.
She has no trace of coquetry —
She hates their having come at all.
She hears and does not hear the closing
She hears it all at every visit.
She hears the raucous laughter swell 
She hurries, but the dreadful shape
She is alone, alack-a-day!
She is not hurried, is not chilly,
She knew, I wonder how. I fear
She knows her role! With none to thank — 
She lacked her sister’s charm, and wanted
She lacks the look of snobbishness,
She lies as though she has not heard,
She lies for hours, with sleep uncertain;
She likes the talk of haughty sages
She looks about in puzzled sort.
She looks about, with heart that flutters:
She looks at him in some dismay.
She looks on nothing with delight.
She looks, half soothed and half excited,
She lost her Frenchy airs and graces;
She loves an uhlan with devotion . . .
She loves him still; and in remorse,
She loves the secrets that environ 
She might return; yes, if permitted. 
She must accept at last, I thought.
She noted, trembling and excited.
She pickled mushrooms with her cooks;
She pinched her waist with tightened laces,
She puzzles till she is distracted,
She quaked at omens; all around her
She reads the sweet romance, and how
She rises as the morning flushes
She runs, he follows on and on;
She said "Akulka” for Celine;
She searches for a passage showing
She seemed a stranger to her own.
She seems the image quite perfected
She sees . . . Why, who would credit it? 
She sees a court she does not know,
She shared our banquets, crowned our joys —
She should go home, where guests are waiting
She shuddered, mute; her lovely eyes
She sighs, she pines both day and night!
She sits with an untroubled air.
She sits with downcast head, too lax
She sought the path, but as she turned, 
She speaks to them as to old friends.
She stands, suffused with shy emotion.
She stifles here . . . her heart is sore.
She suffocates; she scarcely hears
She then, as love has power to do,
She thinks, uncertain, and goes on.
She thumbed her Martin till he knew
She too at length came forth, and nigh 
She trembles like a hunted fawn;
She waits: when will the answer come? 
She walks ahead. The old crone mutters:
She wanders with imagined lovers
She was affianced, but her mother
She was no beauty: that were fiction
She was not one of those who glories
She went. Onegin stood forsaken,
She whispered to herself: ’Tis he!
She will not find her meadows there.
She will not see him, the betrayer;
She would go stumbling down the road.
She would not win you by her face,
Shed rainbow lights across the snow
Shines the resplendent southern sun —
Shorter and shorter grew the days;
Should I not give the letter’s text 
Should cross her path while she was walking, 
Should giddy deity desire
Should howl absurdly: ^It is I!”
Should see how lovely she has grown!
Shouts bravo in his sleep, and then
Show off their impudence, their vests.,
Show rapture or indifference,
Showed him so cold and calm a brow?
Shows passion’s volatility?
Shy as the doe who runs alone.
Simplicity to her young dream?
Since Latin’s held not worth attention,
Since but a random education
Since infancy her only pleasure
Since the dead days of Romulus.
Since time, without my interference,
Since you were christened? Gracious sakes!
Sing a song, a happy song.
Sing and bring a dashing lad
Singer of feasts and tender sorrow,
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Sits down; the game is done — ^he goes;
Sits home, awaiting the reply;
Slapped servant-girls who were unpleasant;
Sleepless, Tatyana would converse 
Slight errors have a choice effect.
Slow eyes come last to rest upon 
Smooth aria, the eager plea.
So Eugene preached and Tanya listened,
So Heaven wills it. Your young soul 
So Tanya bit by bit is learning
So be it! Now my destiny
So be it; but I had to speak;
So countrified, a bit dejected,
So different, first they bored each other.
So easily, with passion seethed;
So elegantly can devise 
So exquisite as sacrifice;
So fortune-telling’s not for us.
So he returned, took Chatzky’s cue.
So pious are they, so precise.
So things went on beside the chilly
So to their destination straightway
So turning morning into night,
Soft glance, nor welcome sweetly caroled.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Some charming spot to hold her still.
Some clue the index may afford her. 
Some dunce may yet pronounce as he 
Some fragment of his Northern art.
Some pages held a sharp incentive
Some, honor’s victims, scarred by war,
Some, prey to piles, or Aphrodite;
Something more certain to amuse.
Sometimes he reads to Olga, trying
Soon brought us, if you please, to Paris,
Soon found a way to soothe her pain;
Soon the dry valleys will be blooming;
Soon, soon my soul will not remember: 
Sounding the cry that all was well;
Spoke of divorce in her despair.

Stares out upon the shadowed lea:
Stay indoors, by a book befriended?
Steel files and combs of various guises,
Steep cliffs above the ocean’s purl,
Stifled, in solitude, unknown.
Still clings to hope, though it be slender.
Still half asleep, nature is meeting
Stood like a threatening apparition;
Stood thunderstruck. He could not stir.
Storm-giver Zeus decrees Odessa
Straight past the porter, like an arrow
Straight to the stranger Tanya speeds,
Strange Jean Sbogar enchants her too.
Strange faces mid the painted set.
Strange woes that left me broken-hearted . . .
Stuff that the Flemish school would draw.
Submissive through the grave’s dark portal. 
Such are the bard’s gratifications;
Such as the Muse alone can bring;
Such bliss is transient, if absurd;
Such faithful friendship as my hero’s
Such feelings in this troubled heart,
Such is the guerdon of your daring!
Such is the news he’s eager for.
Such people with each day grow duller.
Such shoulders I have never known!
Such stuff as Lafontaine has written . . .
Such treachery who could forget?
Such vulgar scenes as these despising.
Suppose your pistol-shot has ended
Surly and languid as Childe Harold.
Surprise, asks: ''Where’s your second, pray?”
Surrendered his inheritance;
Surveying fallow land and plowed.
Suspicious age could do no less,
Sweet Lei now hovers o’er her head.
THEN ONEGIN VISITS TAURIS:
THOU, MY SWEET SVETLANA.
TO ONEGIN
TO ONEGIN But you^re unsociable, they say.
TO ONEGIN Dispel my doubts! My mind^s awhirl;
TO TATYANA
TO TATYANA Already your reproach I hear.
Take off, and smoothly soar away.
Take rest, young poet, as thy wage.”
Take what is offered of delight.
Talon’s Ms goal, no hesitating:
Tanya’s the center of attraction.
Tanya prepared for fortune- telling
Tanya surveys it with a start.
Tanya with simple faith defended
Tanya, her silken belt untying,
Tanya, my dear, your looks distress me.”
Tanya, though she could give no reason,
Tatyana’s
Tatyana’s — comes next Saturday.
Tatyana’s bloom is all but faded;
Tatyana’s brilliant catch discerning,
Tatyana’s husband is appearing.
Tatyana’s letter For days^ until another meeting.
Tatyana’s letter Or but a tempter to undo me?
Tatyana’s letter lies before me,
Tatyana’s match was ail the rumor;
Tatyana’s solitude adds fuel
Tatyana’s trouble; but each eye 
Tatyana burned and shivered, asking:
Tatyana cannot but be grateful
Tatyana cannot stop her tears.
Tatyana does, expecting that the mirror will reflect 
Tatyana fills his every thought;
Tatyana goes, impelled by love.
Tatyana had no doll at all
Tatyana hears the chorus sounding,
Tatyana in the court appears,
Tatyana is alone; but making 
Tatyana leaps like nothing mortal 
Tatyana like a child surrenders 
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana looked as though she heard 
Tatyana might be found romancing
Tatyana moans, and as she shivers
Tatyana read no Russian journal.
Tatyana scanned them without fail.
Tatyana sets the door ajar . . .
Tatyana should be settled, too.
Tatyana shows no sign of caring
Tatyana stares in fascination,
Tatyana thrills with pain and pleasure
Tatyana took her silent way
Tatyana trembled and grew red. 
Tatyana was her name then — granted.
Tatyana was her sister’s name:
Tatyana watched them drive away 
Tatyana, and with failing breath.
Tatyana, breathless, caimot stir;
Tatyana, dear Tatyana! Weeping,
Tatyana, dreaming, walked alone.
Tatyana, spell-bound, lingers still.
Tatyana, still an early riser,
Tatyana, terror-struck, is waking . . »
Tatyana, the society lady, is unexplained and too 
Tatyana, who spoke each one fair;
Tell fortunes, too, but otherwise:
Term vulgar. To my great dismay,
Than anything that I could do —
Than face them; he who has gone through it
Than halt bewildered on the shore.
Than in the north Aurora’s blushes.
Than is the moon one sees at dawn;
Than other men are doomed to feel:
Than that you sought, poor innocent. 
Than this: a household where the wife 
Than with a quite impartial pen 
That’s fine, but if the truth were told.
That’s where the eligibles are!”
That Hymen brings, the grief and pain, 
That I am feeling far from strong; 
That I am not Onegin’s sort;
That I had stained my reputation — 
That I should meet you. God on High 
That I should see you once a week 
That Ovid sang, that brought him here, 
That ancient glory still shines bright . ,
That ardent and most charming letter?
That argues a resourceful poet,
That at Very’s on credit he 
That bodes full flowers and honeyed fruit. 
That burdened my Tatyana’s heart! 
That by a sudden storm was drenched;
That could not very well be worse.
That day would soon be on the march.
That does not frighten anyone
That even thirteen-year-old misses
That fine parquet can never muster.
That forms the ducklings’ paradise.
That have come down the years to us 
That he must have a change of scene
That he, when wheels were within hearing,
That here, for all the world to know it,
That huckleberry syrup will,
That ladies’ feet have had for me.
That little girl ... is it a dream?
That little girl he did not deem
That man alone knows blessedness 
That miracles could be achieved.
That morning, gay and debonair.
That my performance is infernal,
That natiure’s season of renewal 
That no hope of renewal cheers?
That one be potted anyhow,
That only mediocrity 
That only once in a great while.
That our bright pristine hopes grew battered,
That poetry is their affair.
That poets feel, he lacked, nor knew 
That poets owe imto the Muse,
That poor Tatyana was upset.
That riots through the mountain passes;
That scarce had heard of his existence, 
That she’s ideal — he must jot 
That she should offer a narration 
That shows a statuette of iron:
That silently you spoke to me.
That silly moon you see there looming.”
That teeth and nails may both be served.
That the first strophes should be read 
That thrilled him in the days gone by,
That time and change may not erase.
That to such matters Homer pays.
That trembles with another’s passion; 
That waters well the nearby valley.
That we are driving in the dark.
That will not be ten times repeated
That write he must, and in this fashion — 
That year was extraordinary.
That you should scorn me, or ignore.
That youth was given us in vain,
The Academic lexicon.
The British Muse’s wild invention
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew; 
The English spleen it may resemble,
The Hindu — diamonds in his coffer;
The Horse Guard’s spurs clank as he dances;
The Kalmucks’ flocks, contented, graze. 
The Moscow belies are many, too.
The Muse — to marriage been converted.
The Muse first shone before my eyes.
The Muse has come, and love departed,
The Nereids’ low murmuring.
The Russian envoy rescued him and sent hi m as a 
The State for long; the course of things 
The Vampire wrecks her sleep at night;
The afternoon of life is starting,
The aged, at the grave’s grim portal.
The album and the corset vanished,
The album of a country miss,
The arms are crossed — a well-known pose —
The aunts, of one thing only thinking.
The autumn seemed so loth to go;
The baker’s German and precise.
The baker’s wicket opens out,
The balcony where such a press is,
The ball’s wild gaiety was wearing.
The ball had pierced clean through the breast.
The ball-room summons one and all.
The ballroom’s ruler, scarcely human.
The bank; one hears a gentle spring;
The bear is marching at her heels.
The bear says: '^Here my gossip dwells.
The bearded old postilion’s mounted —
The beau monde*s burdensome conventions
The bed-curtains; awake completely,
The bee deserts her waxen cell
The beefsteak and the Strasbourg patty 
The bench where the old nurse was seated 
The billows covered them with kisses,
The billows, while the shrouds are rattling, 
The blithest dawn in sullen clouds.
The blood that burns tmth frantic fire;
The blow of a malignant fate.
The boa on her shoulders, and 
The bold hihitka swiftly traces
The bony hands, the sly grimaces;
The boredom: nabbing the unwary
The box, where, regnant in her splendor.
The breath of life would then infuse.
The bud that just begins to blow.
The bullets are crammed down already;
The cab, to spare the feeble nag.
The call of fame, for you forgot 
The call to early labors dinning;
The carriage horses, chilled with waiting.
The cattle low; the nightingale
The chairs shoved backward scrape the flooring;
The chance to read his modest songs 
The charming and ingenuous maid
The charming lad was rather wild.
The cheerful morning sounds awaken;
The child of shrewdness and of daring,
The child while still at play prepares
The children learn their A-B-C.
The chilly dark the girl is sharing
The city breathes of Europe; hotly.
The city soon will wear resounding
The classic trumpet, sword, and mask; 
The clouds before him — can it be?
The coachmen round the bonfires tramp.
The cold pretensions to success.
The colonel’s sending it. A ball!
The columns of the city gate
The company commander, whom 
The company could see no harm
The comrade upon whom she doted.
The contemplative dryads played.
The cordial words: 'There was a poet!” 
The cost of post-horses, was glad 
The coughs, the shouts and hisses sounding.
The country life, the rustic hovels.
The country round about was still,
The country to the past is tender.
The country, and its dulness, bore you;
The couple stood, to say good-bye.
The couples as they whirl aw*ay,
The couples to the table swarm;
The courtyard white, a white parterre,
The creature bellows in reply 
The creatures fancy animated;
The creditors began to gather,
The crooked trunks, the gleaming claw^s.
The crowd of house-sprites, blowing out 
The crowd whose sparkle nothing dims,
The crowd, the hubbub, and the glitter!
The cruel fates have surely not 
The crunch of snow . , « a step approaches;
The curtain rustles as it soars;
The customs that our elders knew.
The czar caroused with zest, but mark!
The dale is dark and vapor-ridden.
The darkened mind is clear again; 
The darling object was provided
The dawn shines ruddy; Olga rushes 
The day is done: he’s not replying,
The day my father gave his blessing;
The day of busy cares is blessed.
The day to come, what is it bearing?
The day upon which they intended
The day was set, his heart elated;
The days speed by; before you know it
The dazzling capital, forgot —
The dead man buried, they were able
The dedication is addressed to Pyotr Alexandro-
The dining-room: on chairs they slumber. 
The dogs attack her, all but biting
The dolts that must be tolerated.
The door swings wide, and Lensky’s here,
The double windows, the snug fire;
The dread of vice, the fear of shame.
The dreaded one, the dearly prized:
The dream alarms her, and not knowing
The dream pervades her mournful moods.
The driver on his box we note
The drum is heard, the city’s rousing,
The editor has followed closely the text of the first
The end of the mazurka, and 
The enemies their mantles doff.
The errors are a trifle merely.
The exile from society
The eyeglass of the connoisseur.
The eyes of the ingenuous young;
The faces one meets everywhere;
The fair ones, whom you were addressing 
The fair young pilgrim must go home.
The faithful one is soon affected:
The family is well; they send you
The family would meet and talk,
The fashion of a bygone day:
The fatal hour is past recall;
The father’s simple words repeating.
The fathers, indeed all, could see
The fear, the shame, are past endurance . . .
The fearful bill, unheeded, mounts.
The feast goes on, but soon thereafter
The feast he was quite unprepared for, 
The feast makes every move a labor.
The feasts where wealth and wit were squandered,
The few who relish toil and teen).
The fields’ and forests’ solitude
The fields with droplets once again), 
The fierce flames reddening the skies.
The fiery glance, he could but find
The fine keen wit of yesteryear 
The fire is out; the ashes, shifting,
The first clear picture is disclosing
The first gay snowflakes spin once more
The first shy rays begin to gleam;
The flash of wit, the flouncing dress.
The floor is oak; two chests, a table,
The flower of life that blooms but once.
The flying hours no one counts.
The foes stood by, with downcast eyes.
The foes! How long had they been parted
The folly of a simple girl:
The foreign tongue is native to
The friend of Bacchus, Mars, and Venus,
The friend of wintry cottage nights.
The friends, without delaying,
The frightened maiden gathers strength
The frost-work o’er the panes was twining;
The frosts begin to snap, and gleaming
The frozen corpse Zaretzky places.
The frozen funds of intellection —
The furnishings are plain and stable.
The gallants for their hostess vying.
The gamblers, worthy men and bold:
The game he can at last forget;
The gathering, affected by it
The general, since such tributes flatter 
The gentry all cried out in scorn,
The gifts the newcomer possessed;
The girl, stands rooted to the spot*
The girlish secrets of the heart,
The girls with Olga and Tatyana
The girls, off by themselves, conspire;
The glitter of the noisy press.
The glories of these frosty days.
The glory’s gone, I know not why;
The goal is there before them. Blazing
The golden bubbles rising lightly
The golden tongue Italians speak;
The good wdfe took her husband’s measure. 
The gossips ever are malicious,
The grandfathers it promptly urges.
The grove’s asleep. The wind blows chill.
The grove, the bridge, the lake, and on.
The guests’ sly glances were enough.
The guests are early in arriving.
The guests are greeted with delight;
The guests, arriving, hear their laughter. 
The hall is packed to suffocation,
The hallowed letters O and E.
The hammers on the ramrods knock;
The happiness of youth must pass.
The happy man who took no chance
The harbor is a busy sight;
The hat is cocked, the brow morose.
The haughty creatures may inspire
The haughty portrait of Lord Byron,
The hazy dawn commences coldly.
The heart of the confirmed coquette!
The heart once more with hope will glow.
The heart recalls its ancient scars,
The heart that thought its fires had dwindled
The heart with virgin tenderness?
The hearth breathes warmth, and all’s serene;
The hearts of both now spurned the flame
The heavens glow with azure light.
The helpless girl can do no more
The herd no longer drives his cattle,
The hero’s named, the work’s begun;
The hero we’re intent upon.
The highroad, leveled altogether,
The hoar-frost in the sun a -shimmer.
The hope on which my heart is fed?
The hopeful youth was quick to find 
The horns and hoofs, the whiskered faces,
The horse who scents him snorts and quivers,
The horses scent the dead, and foam
The horses to an oak near by.
The hostess cries. Guests squeeze together,
The hot fat cutlets; you would say 
The hour called ^^entre chien et loup^^^
The hour for waking and for sleeping;
The hours allotted me by Fate,
The hours go by: they do not waken;
The house hummed like a hive of bees
The house rocks with applause; undaunted,
The housekeeper a slow good-bye;
The husband enters: the appalling
The icy river shows a luster
The idol of all maids in bloom.
The image trembling in the glass
The imps and cupids, quick as monkeys,
The insults time heaps on her head 
The jagged flint still harmless, lifted.
The jesting mixed with flattery . . .
The joys they knew have all proved mortal.
The kindly fates had fancied me.
The ladies’ little feet fly by.
The ladies all pressed closer to her;
The ladies enter; now it’s gliding 
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The ladies, each a picture when
The lady’s lasting admiration
The lady of the house: she’s fled —
The lame Turgenev for his nation
The land that knew my love, my pain, 
The landed gentleman has brought 
The language of the gods rejected . . .
The languor and the flame of love 
The languors of a distant day.
The last chapter of Eugene Onegin was published
The law of Fate is ever just.
The lazy Orient longer dozes.
The leaps, the heels, the whiskers fair. 
The less we love her, sooth to say —
The letter’s ready to be sent;
The letter shakes; she heaves a sigh;
The letter to you quite intact.
The letters that he wrote so neatly,
The lies that journals perpetrate,
The lifting mist reveals the pleasant
The lighted stage, and with a yawn 
The lights, bewildering the rout;
The lily -stem, and withers so
The little feet and lovely limbs;
The little tricks that are affected
The lively Muse was at my side
The loads on the kibitkas sway.
The local Paris: Petushkov,
The lofty madcap! — but no matter:
The lofty passion, the pure pleasure
The lonely gloom was hard to bear.
The lonely thicket where a stream
The loss of it I could not bear.
The loud finale sounds, and pushing,
The lovelorn boy ignored them quite.
The lovely ladies’ filmy dresses.
The lover’s language, the sweet vow,
The lustrous tea-cups, never spilling 
The magazines that like to scold
The magic of the bow obeying,
The maiden lies there, pale as death.
The maids and coachmen vie in swearing; 
The maids would gleefully foretell 
The man? Or vanity, forsooth?
The mansion j&rom its firm foundation
The mansion, hy a hill well hidden,
The marker on the balcony
The marriage-broker kept on pressing
The married rakes, no longer naughty.
The masses of your mountains gleamed,
The master had no need to scold
The masters of the berry -crop.
The matchless bore — on these she mused; 
The matter for a fortnight; oh.
The maxims her mamma has taught.
The meadows’ solitary look,
The men who’d set the peasants free.
The menu hangs there, in plain sight.
The merchant’s wife, so young and slender. 
The merchant, to the port is faring 
The merry and monotonous round.
The messenger was not kept waiting:
The mighty Peter in his youth;
The mind’s reflections coldly noted,
The modern Russian’s worst disease.
The moment that I saw you coming,
The mooB’s enchantment so obsessed her.
The moon has risen; in a light 
The moon her magic vigil kept.
The moon is fading with the night;
The moon, the lampion of heaven.
The most congenial of men.
The mother fell to figuring
The mother groans. "It drives me wild;
The mountain maid, untamed, inspiring,
The music, he would whisper low 
The mystic, wistful hours of night;
The naked woods surprise the sight,
The name-day feast is soon begun.
The nasal twang she also banished.
The neighbor now declares: ''He’s killed.”
The neighbors’ heads and tongues are wagging:
The neighbors promptly called and twaddled
The neighbors, pleasantly diverted,
The newcomers but ape the old;
The news gives Tanya little pleasure.
The nightingale’s keen melodies
The nightingale, this season’s lover,
The noble taste of bygone days.
The noise is queer and terrifying.
The north wind breathes and bellows, driving
The noses blown, and without pause.
The novelist had long since won;
The nurse alone might well have guessed,
The nurse replied: "God save you, daughter!”
The old assessor, paralytic?
The old fat counsellor, Flyanov,
The old gray nurse thinks she is napping
The old man had no time to look
The olden sorrows I regret.
The opera summons — in a word,
The orchestra’s already drooping;
The other day in rainy weather
The other slowly circles, thus,
The ox with lowered horns must drag
The oysters? They have come! In rapture
The page he read could scarcely bore him.
The pail is brought, the ice is clinking
The painful dream forever broken!
The pair of us had planned to wander,
The parlor’s crowded; barking pugs,
The parlor hums with conversation,
The passer-by may read it clear:
The passions, though, concerned more often
The pattern of a paragon.
The peddler plods, the merchant dresses,
The pen makes mock of such as he.
The pencil-marks he made with care
The people’s lore of days gone by;
The perishable human crop.
The phrasing, awkward or mistaken,
The pile of books no longer read,
The pines, their boughs on every hand 
The pistols gleam, held straight and steady;
The placid course of rustic leisure;
The plain girl’s love? Why, even now,
The plan I had no pains to settle,
The plans to have been consummated,
The pleasures relished, triumphs thwarted;
The poet’s ardent speech, the mind
The poet’s earliest elation
The poet did not think of stopping
The poet in his exaltation
The poet in the very dawn
The poet is no more ... his lot
The poet lets his pistol fall.
The poet, and he may, forsooth,
The poet, and the world will follow 
The poet, swift in thought and action,
The poet, with impatience burning.
The poisonous vUe worm that mumbles
The polite ”yes” that is behooving.
The poor girl stands there, almost senseless;
The poor old lady, broken-hearted.
The poor shy girl whose adoration
The poor thing nearly swoons; she’s ill.
The pranks and jokes of former years.
The press is thick, the hubbub loud.
The prima donna? The ballet?
The prince’s comrade and relation 
The prince invites him to be present 
The princess, and her feeble cries 
The princess, pale, in neglige.
The prisoned girls of the Salgir,
The profile that a move will blur
The promise of her spring was blighted,
The proud lorgnettes the ladies hold
The purling of a gentle brook;
The quarrel grows; Onegin quickly
The queen, aloof, remote, imperious.
The race of men recks nothing, save
The rain of passion is not cruel.
The rapids and the underbrush
The reason doesn’t really matter.)
The relatives — and there are dozens —
The rings are plucked; each maiden, sighing, 
The rings that the new mode dictated.
The river and its banks are leveled;
The road is lost and past divining.
The rogue, who somehow would escape 
The roofs, the fence, all molded fair;
The room grows loud with talk and laughter, 
The room where the old man berated
The room, though not without a sigh.
The rooms are thronged and hot and gay.
The rosy dawn brings forth the sun,
The rustic cyclop labors, daft,
The ruts and ditches that abound
The sad Yakushkin, it would seem,
The same consuming agony.
The samovar, that blest invention,
The saucers of preserve about.
The scene where first I saw your face,
The science of revolt was slow
The science of the tender passion
The sea, the southern sun for basking . . .
The secret shame with which I burned^
The secret she will never mention,
The secrets of the nuptial bed;
The senses soon grew blunt and dull.
The servants gather at the gates 
The servants gave him all assistance,
The sex, of course, is light as do’^m.
The shades of night are growing thinner.
The shadows creep across the sill.
The shaggy monster seizes her,
The sharks who feed on gamblers’ passions
The shepherd’s horn awakes the peasant;
The shutters closed, the windows blear
The shutters open; chimneys spout;
The sight of them produces spleen.
The sign with shaking hand, she prayed.
The silence at long last is broken
The silent fields, abandoned, wait,
The silent stars, the brooding moon —
The simple girl whose dreams, whose ways.
The simple lines there graven, she 
The simple talk flows readily.
The sky breathed autumn, somber, shrouded;
The sledge awaits. He does not tarry:
The sleepless fellow’s heart and head.
The sly thrall struggle to be free.
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The snow is reaching to her knee;
The snows still gleaming softly pink,
The soul so shy of happiness;
The sound of Russian when correct;
The sounding waves’ eternal chorus,
The source of tears and happiness.
The spirit of an oddish dreamer.
The splendid mansion shines and gleams, 
The spot itself was God-forsaken.
The square grows lively now and dizzy
The stalls are seething, the pit roars,
The stars of night are fair and many,
The state relied, his friends were told. 
The steward came here when requested;
The storm and strife, the frequent feast; 
The storms which shook it like a leaf
The story of these fragmentary stanzas,
The stove with colored tiles, appealing
The strains of Albion’s proud lyre 
The strait-laced innocent beguile 
The stranger. At her frightened cry,
The street-lamps’ pallid substitute.
The subject of an argmnent?
The subject, give me your attention:
The sudden soimd of hoofs! . . . She freezes.
The sun appears, a brief snow-flurry
The table shone with wax; they handed
The tails and tusks and bloody jaws.
The talk is seasoned well thereafter 
The talk would turn with strange persistence
The tea. I note the hour, or nearly,
The tender feelings and the brave?
The tender leaves, but in the spring 
The tender torments, and the sadness, 
The tender verse. Princess Pauline;
The terraced scene, the view unfolding 
The theatre’s full, the boxes glitter,
The theatre’s wicked legislator.
The theme from which he ne’er departed
The thing that makes the world go round.
The things that I concoct in lonely
The third day interest abated
The thirst for knowledge, toil, and fame.
The thoughts of youth so high and grave.
The three kibitkas customary
The throng with a mute eye commanding?
The time came when he quite abhorred
The time had come — she was in love.
The time of tempting nights approaches,
The time run on, and in the middle
The times improve, and better us!
The tinsel of unwelcome days,
The tom-cat calls the tabby
The tone the gentlemen employed,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The touching glasses chime and clink.
The trace you left has long since perished
The traveler observes and shivers 
The tread of passion augurs tears:
The treasure none can ever guess,
The trees in wintry silver gleamed;
The truest source of inspiration:
The truth, and, God be praised, can see 
The tune, however, threatens her;
The tw"o explore the garden’s charm.
The two Skotinins, gray as sages.
The two friends’ greetings; and the tears 
The two old women weep, embrace.
The unconcerned beloved anew.
The vapor wreathes the china pot.
The verses came — but who would know it? —
The version of it given here 
The very boon they would petition,
The very hero of our novel!
The very plains where Wittgenstein
The very words Onegin wrote.
The view into the moonlit night.
The village, where Onegin’s leisure
The vintage of the comet flows.
The vision of a peerless girl,
The vista of a free romance!
The voice of mistress, foe, and friend,
The volumes at long last succeeding 
The war, the snow-fall, and his mate.
The waters, where they boil and toss;
The way a Russian verse is turned.
The weak would mend life’s fraying thread;
The well-known clubman, who, God bless us, 
The while Zaretzky with a sneer
The while she howls both long and loud;
The while we hear the woodland sing?
The whist -players are Hon-hearted:
The whole day through in solitude.
The will to rule is seen thus early:
The wind, would enter, gently warning
The window, where he read it through.
The winter, Barclay, Russia’s God?
The wit Triquet, late of Tambov.
The wolf beside his hungry mate.
The women mowing oft repair
The woods, Tatyana stayed at home,
The word is one I can’t translate:
The words again with stifled moan.
The world’s oblivious animation.
The world of glory thus bereaving,
The world without, Tatyana crept.
The world would gain if it should learn 
The world, the ball, are both forgot,
The wretched story out, complete —
The year’s bright dawn with gentle greeting.
The years to rugged prose constrain me.
The young Othello is delighted!
The young and hopeful brides-to-be,
The young tell fortimes, all are jolly.
The younger beauties will declare
The youth was called on every hand
The youthful heart; I will defy
Their arms about each other, creep 
Their conquests and their pranks with glee;
Their daughters, after due embraces.
Their endlessly protracted caU.
Their freezing glances framed to hurt you.
Their gestmes marked by firm decision,
Their judgment both men freely gave.
Their looks enchant, their words are sweet, 
Their love, though tempests fill the air.
Their mark the temple or the thigh.
Their marriage was a certainty.
Their masters wearily berating.
Their meetings passed; in turn they spoke
Their monocles that rake the guests.
Their nags, huts, mansions, monasteries,
Their news, their gossip — all arc stale.
Their pangs, and he, remote from love,
Their rapid bubbles hissing still;
Their steaming cups have barely stirred 
Their very slander has no color;
Their voices, and their words were kind, 
Them both aside and only for a 
Themselves to find out his intent.
Then I required, as I protested,
Then Olga’s suitor paid a visit.
Then Russia did as she was bidden.
Then all is changed. For lo! she veers,
Then at the rug that decks the bed,
Then buzzing, all sit down to dine.
Then dipped into some vile review.
Then disappointed beyond measure, 
Then fell again to talking of
Then flash with pride and flame with anger, 
Then he came up to her and said: 
Then he presents the madrigal.
Then he suggests they sit one out.
Then let each man be on his mettle:
Then liking grew: they met each day
Then muttered on in ecstasy.
Then plunged into domestic labors:
Then they demand in compensation
Then wafted as by Eolus
Then what a poem I’ll contrive 
Then you will weep, but who supposes
Then, aiming at his pallid brow.
Then, at a party he attends
Then, hurry, hurry to the fields!
Then, in the flower of his youth?
Then, with a look that showed her tiring,
Theocritus and Homer bored him ;
There’s gloom and darkness all about;
There’s little here that’s exquisite.
There Muravyov showed pluck and force,
There Pestel ... for the tyrants . . .
There Shakovskoy brought noisy laughter
There a Circassian’s horse goes flying;
There are no inns. In a cold cottage
There at her feet, as they would do.
There bold Fonvizin, freedom’s friend,
There is a dinner-party daily
There is a quickening at the root
There is a roaring in her ears . . .
There is no answer to his letter;
There is no calumny so deep.
There is no notion so erratic.
There is no sleep for such as she.
There is no sparkle here of wit;
There is the spot if you would know it:
There may the lyre sound clear and free,
There one can make a declaration,
There other things were done and bruited.
There pours in torrents from his pen 
There sings all night; wild roses cover
There the Petrovsky Palace, hiding
There the impassive general
There was a time when the impassioned
There was a time when the portrayal
There, when the tardy moon was shining. 
There, wistful-eyed, behold her stand,
Thereby our eighteen-year -old sage.
Therewith a bottle of light wine,
These artless lines can never bore me.
These friends! ’tw^as not for nothing that 
These guests, and somehow keeps her seat.
These many years, to me, or you.
These proud reflections all portend:
These spoke to her with silent force.
These warnings in your ears are dinned 
These were the secret fond traditions
They’d come to an old aunt, now failing —
They’d sup, then time for sleep drew nigh.
They’ll cock the trigger and let fly,
They’re duller than the things we write.
They’ve played eight rubbers at a stretch.
They are so clever, so serene.
They bark and whistle, sing and screech. 
They came into my mind so pat.
They chase the dogs away, alert
They chew. The pleasant prandial chink
They chortle, argue, shout and squeak.
They climg as brother clings to brother.
They come, they conquer, and they flee.
They come. Quite unaffected still.
They cross themselves, their heads incline,
They dared not let their voices drop:
They do not change, depend upon it.
They eye our heroine askance.
They face Tatyana, who is paler
They find her odd — so unaffected.
They gallop snorting o’er the snow.
They glow, they burn, the ecstasies
They gossiped on, in high good humor.
They had their private meetings, whether
They had to travel for a week.
They hitch them to the master’s sleigh; 
They learned, and we, before we leave.
They like to fill a man with fear.
They liked to tread a country measure;
They look like fenceposts, flashing by.
They loosed my braids, and singing low
They loved the good old ways, and wallowed
They married her sans her consent.
They met; except that both were human.
They only sent him off to sleep.
They rouse are those of youthful kisses, 
They say that life does not afford
They say the ladies should read Russian,
They set a table laid for two;
They settled dowm on his estate.
They sought to make love’s ties more binding 
They still can thrill me in my dreams.
They stop because the servants fetch 
They take her to the Club for dances.
They too were of their duties heedful,
They took communion twice a year;
They touch the springs of reverie.
They travel homeward quickly, choosing.
They traveled, but a dull hour passed 
They vanish, claimed by the unknown;
They waltz, they bow, they curtsey, flitting
They were unlike as any two men:
They whisper: ^’Dimya, pay attention!”
Thick coffee Orientals prize:
Thinking of Eugene all the while.
Thinks sadly: ''Why am I not ailing.
Thirty -two paces with precision;
This Martin Zadeka, it seems,
This clever jester had to suffer.
This ditty sounds for Tanya’s ring:
This estimable friend embracing.
This ever -rapturous hero, burning
This giddy play in fancy-dress.
This horseman the Pope consecrated,
This insult was not to be borne.
This is no rhetoric I’m using:
This learned opus one fine day 
This pool we bathe in, friends, this muck 
This strange and sorry character,
This subject filled his conversations.
This too was the old master’s nook;
This warlike rover who was fated
This way is of all fates the worst.
This whiskered regiment diverted
Thither she came to sport and sing
Those fleshy anchorites alive 
Those gentle hands were stained with gore
Those lovely lips; is it not true?
Thou epic Muse! Upon my way
Though Eugene lent a willing ear.
Though I was worthy your belief,
Though great, the poet’s not conceited.
Though he pursued, the chase was palling; 
Though he was brave, though he was gifted,
Though innocent, are quite absurd.
Though it is true your recollection 
Though it suggests a peasant’s hovel,
Though now a light of no repute.
Though on occasion hke a duffer
Though once they praised my magic pen:
Though there are people, most malicious,
Thought sermons fashioned to annoy;
Thoughts of the future made him whistle;
Three ladies mention a soiree.
Three pairs of truly pretty feet.
Three-fifty was the price bespoken,
Through empty day and idle night:
Through lofty tree-tops everywhere;
Through silent woods, and she discovers 
Through spectacles, with failing eyes,
Through the dim room where I am sitting.
Thus Eugene thought with melancholy.
Thus Lensky his good Mend defended.
Thus a gray hare will quake with fright 
Thus a poor moth imprisoned seeks
Thus autumn gusts deal death and treason.
Thus brilliantly begins the ball.
Thus darkly drives the storm that shrouds 
Thus far away her thoughts are flying;
Thus grows a seed the earth has hidden 
Thus he grew restless and decided
Thus once again he manifested
Thus people, frankly I confess,
Thus sunk in reveries, he nearly
Thus to rush forth, then lapse in quiet
Thus you, Yazykov, when affection
Thus, for an evening game of whist,
Till Lensky, too absorbed to look,
Till from his dressing-room he’d pass.
Till somehow the long evening’s ended,
Till travel, as you’ll have inferred,
Time was when all the world was vying
Time was when she would be composing
To -write in French . , . What’s to be done? 
To 0 . . . our neighbor. Oh, but he
To Eugene, who at once goes dancing 
To Lensky’s wrath: he would not see
To Moscow: it’s the brides’ bazaar;
To Olga’s voice: away she went,
To Olga. First they spin about.
To Olga: "I am happy— no?”
To Tanya of the days that were;
To a new pose will he be goaded,
To a toilette you must admire,
To an ambitious author’s whims:
To answer when the lady speaks.
To ask Anisya for the key.
To be his relative’s sole heir.
To be united to his own,
To brush the shy lips of a maiden 
To call it dirty is no lie.
To call that friend of freedom wrong.
To cast forced shade upon the street.
To choose such moral tales as might 
To classicism doffed my hat:
To come today, and without fail.
To crowding slaves on every side?
To darkness’ kind abode repairing,
To decent folk, and with a smile.
To disavow- it now-. I read
To do full justice to the table,
To drink a toast to his fair neighbor,
To drown the jealous whispering.
To dwell on sorry things so long.
To earn a luncheon from the two,
To earn a smile, a dream, a tear.
To face our foes as all men must,
To find a Moscow magazine
To flowery field and village sport,
To flute and viol’s merry sound.
To follow you with deep devotion;
To fondle either parent never
To free its wings, and frantic, pushes
To friend and child and faithful wife;
To gather tribute from the dell.
To get it, friends, do you recall?
To give me over to despair.
To go: he had no wish to stay.
To gossip to about the city
To gossip; but her heart would fill 
To grasp things . . . But you’re growing pale;
To hang upon the young bloods’ tales.
To hapless Tanya . . . Well, and so 
To have our roads completely mended, 
To have two friends at daggers drawn 
To have your humble servant tell
To hear a people’s hymn of praise.
To hear a voice cry: ^'Well? He’s killed.” 
To hear the vulgar chatter there.
To her a tiresome thing she dreamed. 
To her dear hero she addresses.
To her to whom his heart belongs,
To her vain passion day by day;
To him of whom indeed I sing . . •
To him; and thereby sadly daunted, 
To his Tatyana makes his way.
To his assassins without ruth.
To his dear charmer his own verses?
To his estate about this time 
To his sharp judgments, sullen wit.
To hold the pistol straight and steady;
To holding poets’ sweet inventions.
To horse’s stamp and human speech!
To humble kings and make them fawn.
To hurry them: he cannot wait.
To join the hateful worldly flurry.
To keep his hopeless ledgers clear.
To kiss the breast with languor laden;
To know Onegin really well.
To know you: spirit tuned to spirit;
To learn my Eugene’s air of scorn.
To leave . . . Our Eugene could not stir.
To leave such quiet haunts as these 
To leave, is gone; they let time slip 
To let the tender habit seize me;
To let the worldlings take the measure
To liken do-re-mi to wine.
To listen to you, late and soon;
To long to clasp your knees, and, throbbing
To love all ages owe submission;
To love and idleness devoted.
To make a guest exclaim at it.
To make a lasting deep impression.
To make a man feel like an ass,
To make his noble coflSn ready:
To make the soul of man rejoice 
To masquerade in male attire.
To me all this is naught. This minute
To me alone he dedicated! . . .’?
To meet his fathers speedily;
To merchants; we have but one fear:
To method, he would not allow 
To mist her wide and tender eyes.
To mourn his absence, and in vain.
To move you even while you slept;
To my old nurse, my childhood’s friend;
To no one, friends, you must believe me:
To note how little she is stirred;
To one who is but half-alive:
To one whose soul has perished, and 
To overhear what they may say.
To play a game of cards with me,
To play with tender reveries.
To plunge their tinkling pitchers there,
To poetry’s exalted flame;
To praise his mind if not his heart,
To praise the dancer now the rage,
To praises imaccustomed grown.
To prink and preen he’d ask no urging,
To promenade, as all do daily.
To reading, where a finger-nail 
To rest from loads I used to bear.
To rest the nags: the halts were boring. 
To roam the forests, green and deep.
To save his honor stood quite ready 
To say, with sorrow in her eyes:
To scan the flags and see what sails 
To scratch her neck, and stubbornly
To see a pedant in a bonnet!
To sit beside an invalid!
To sketch a woman’s legs or head.
To sleep upon the stove.
To soil the sheets with flying quill;
To stand, dear vision, by my bed?
To stormy gaiety a traitor,
To suffer prison, and would fly 
To sunny gardens’ fragrant toil;
To tag each other, or to roam 
To take aim also — ^but just then 
To take the awful cargo home.
To take the letter up and seal it 
To talk and sigh, to jest or grieve
To tempt the sporting man of fashion.
To tempt with tender word and sigh
To tender him the Kremlin keys.
To the inviting sea would fly.
To the kind invalid, and yet 
To the low grave, to sit and weep.
To the low roof to fetch her measure 
To the young ladies what was fated.
To these long letters and these tears.
To think the girl that he adored
To this half-Russian, German-bred.
To this were fribbling hours devoted,
To travel, you must be desiring 
To use her own, and hence they had 
To utter, yet she’d not a trace.
To wander by the lake at leisure,
To wash his face with careful paw,
To watch the swans in some dim valley 
To which we vowed our walks apart,
To which, God help me, I belong.
To whom these faces all appear
To whom your pensive verse belong?”
To win her — showed her such attention! 
To youthful hearts its tempests bring
Today it is my turn to speak.
Together in the forest gloaming;
Together nudge Tatyana and
Together we have traveled far.
Took punishment once in a way.
Took wilful passion for my guide;
Torment the rhymesters a la mode.
Touched by the careless twittering,
Toward the moon her languid gaze,
Towers above the craggy hills,
Town that’s delivered to the flood,
Transparent veil the sky is muffled.
Travels how different a road —
Triquet turns, with his sheet, to her,
Triquet; next follow two adepts:
Truly, a beatific land.
Tufted with snow; the stars are shining 
Tug at the leather rein, and turning
Tulchin, where the Spring shines betimes. 
Tumansky in sonorous stanzas
Turn pale or blush, as one distressed . . .
Tutored by her own wit — she duly 
Two Petriads, and a collection
Two days he found it quite diverting:
Two fluffy furrows as it races;
Two girls would come, and sadly twining 
Two hearts, a torch, and flowers, be sure, 
Two hearts, one may perhaps believe.
Two merchants have already met.
Two minutes passed with neither speaking,
Two slender boughs are flung across
Two-legged millions are our tools;
U pon your honor I depend.
Unbidden guests; the scene abashes 
Undressed at last and went to bed.
Unheeded in her great dark eyes.
Unhesitatingly she ran.
Unknown to butterfly and bee.
Unless indeed we send a card
Unspoiled by the vain show and fleeting
Until Breguet’s unsleeping chime
Until a great discovery
Until the flames blazed up anew
Until, near dawn, his head was dropping 
Unutterably dear and fair.
Up through the flue the pipe -smoke passes; 
Up to its roof was past all praise. 
Up to the steps, in coach and shay, 
Upon ''ideal” — modish word —
Upon Zarema? To the same 
Upon a fair Venetian face,
Upon a succulent fat pie
Upon a trailing branch suspended
Upon each other’s necks they fall.
Upon her balcony alone
Upon her heart, as though a rumbling 
Upon her shamed and flaming cheeks;
Upon her tray a steaming cup:
Upon her wrath her lips are sealed.
Upon his brow the mark of death,
Upon his sledge tries out the road;
Upon its staples, not on gold —
Upon my dreaming soul intrude.
Upon the azure, pale and tender.
Upon the bachelor’s sad existence;
Upon the banks by Dnieper raided,
Upon the boards still flutter free,
Upon the chapters in your hand, 
Upon the couch, a riding-crop.
Upon the dam leaned Lensky, waiting.
Upon the death of his dear father
Upon the distant hills lay light.
Upon the dull mind’s slumbers break.
Upon the finished product then;
Upon the floor Triquet we view 
Upon the good old-fashioned ways 
Upon the granite parapet.
Upon the magic of that stream —
Upon the nameless river’s shore
Upon the oak her tufts are hung;
Upon the pages everywhere 
Upon the parlor sofa lies
Upon the patriarchal dust,
Upon the sharp -clawed paw he offers,
Upon the steppes that it invaded,
Upon the stove the cat elected
Upon the streets the snow is lying,
Upon the table gleam the glasses,
Upon the table, piping hot;
Upon the third of January,
Upon the threshold of his grave.
Upon the urn, and think: Til -fated!
Upon those lines of bis commending 
Upon those very boards thereafter.
Upon voluptuous rugs instead.
Upon whose brows methought was hell’s 
Us all, and where I now am told 
V Desert at last the restless city
V He hit an ace, there’s no denying,
V Hence oft he had his stallion saddled
V Is like the poet’s maid, Svetlana,
V She knew what dreams and cards portended,
V To sad Moldavia she wandered.
V With us, to miss a reputation
VI And into golden fragments shivered.
VI And jealous fears my heart are stinging
VI And one and all of them exerted
VI Of Juvenal he could make mention.
VI On secret or on open chaffing.
VI Through meadowland and linden alley.
VI Was also picked to pieces duly,
VVll Alas, in dreams, asleep or waking,
Vague threats, predictions, and suspicions,
Vast wastes, and billows diamond-crested.
Verse full of amatory foUy,
Viewed by the archive youths w^ho cluster
Vladimir Lensky, handsome, youthful,
Vladimir made a dry response 
Vladimir shuts the book, and then
Vladimir too had odes to write,
Vladimir was completely captured
Vli Trochaic from iambic measure,
Vll A wreath, that by the breeze befriended
Vll And later privately defame them
Vll And the assorted ranks and ages,
Vll Since nature, fond of contradiction,
Vll With equal warmth a comrade’s greeting
Vlll A shape wherein imagination
Vlll Admired his judgment, always steady.
Vlll Alas! a young and lively maiden
Vlll And I am not exaggerating
Vlll And as of yore play the odd fellow?
Vlll And day by day in pensive yearning
Volcanic Naples broke the peace,
Volume the third of Marmontel,
W hen he comes, ah, when he comes.
W hy did you come to visit us?
W'^e ... we don'll shine in any way.
W'hose raptures are forever stilled.
WHERE WILL YOU FIND A BETTER PLACE, GOOD SIR? 
Wades through the streets, if he but can;
Walked to the stream below the hill; 
Wants one thing further, more’s the pity;
Was all the art of love required.
Was bold enough to challenge you —
Was bored again beyond all measure; 
Was bored with everything he tried,
Was but a boy, if truth were told.
Was ever harder task invented?
Was he the carefree soul he seemed?
Was it not thus I long since spent
Was it not you who gently gave me
Was jesting subtly and displaying 
Was love: he sang it late and soon,
Was one that I found exquisite.
Was our morose Tatyana’s way.
Was pleasure happiness in sooth
Was quite the rustic engineer.
Was reverie; she wreathed with dream 
Was sleeping, heedless of the clock;
Was the interpreter of dreams.
Was the sad singer shocked to learn 
Was then our ruler, as you know.
Was to a single occupation;
Was to be readily forgot.
Was with Tatyana — ^not, forsooth,
Was wooed by passionate young devils*
Was yet a thorough Russian; hence
Watched fondly, in seclusion growing,
We’ll go together , . . Oh, my chest! . . .
We’ll listen to the forest voices.
We’ll split apart the mountain ridges,
We’re all Napoleons, we’re certain —
We’re put to sleep by moral tales;
We both had played with passion, early
We both had wearied of the game;
We buy with timber and with tallow:
We call it — if no trace I find 
We can’t please the fastidious.
We careless fellows leave the fretting
We have so many neighbors, I
We loved them, though, when we were young
We met by chance; /, though^ perceiving
We need the wit that nature gave us 
We scared patrols with blatant noise;
We shall have arched, cast-iron bridges
We show at aU times due respect,
We sing about a lucky maid.
We think good wishes are the thing.
We were in reverie transported.
We win the game that w^e are playing.
We won good old Derzhavin’s blessing
We yet attend upon the word
We yielded to delicious dreaming.
Wearied by what he had desired.
Wearing a look of self-possession,
Well I remember waves in riot
Well, must you go now? Not so fast!
Well, take it, since you are so sly!).
Went forth, in dress — a London dandy.
Went off and talked in solemn wise;
Went raving mad or worse: became 
Wept o’er her daughter as they parted,
Were all of them, as well you know.
Were all unconsciously revealing:
Were banished by her animation,
Were bliss; and death? I should not fear it!
Were greeted, with almost dismaying
Were in no instance trained upon her,
Were it not better, if before
Were ladies of a certain age,
Were proper people to engage;
Were set upon those casks of wine.
Were signs and warnings to confound her — 
Werther, to be a martyr fated,
What’s said beside the fading fire.
What London haberdashers hallow
What anguished longing held me fast!
What are her reveries unspoken?
What biting words the rogue would utter
What came of it: Always prepared.”
What dazzling hopes awhile are yours.
What difference does that make to me?
What does my future hold in store?”
What hidden meaning in it lies.
What is he? A mere imitation,
What is it? Water! And this lack 
What languor fills her lovely breast!
What languor in her magic glances!
What more is asked? The world is warm
What more, my friends, do you demand? 
What of it? Though his eyes were busy,
What of the tryst, then, so iU-fated?
What passage, what remark delighted
What petty thought? What trivial feeling? 
What pride, what grief, what thoughts of her!
What shipments are in quarantine?
What sight thus fills him with dismay?
What such a nightmare signifieso 
What talk of famine, plague, or war?
What tears I shed you do not know.
What the word relatives embraces.
What time it is with no Breguet 
What verse, what talk, how fair a dream!
What, in the country, when it’s dreary.
Whate’er was to befall Vladimir,
Whatever in these careless stanzas
When Eugene reached the restless season
When I am gone, and cannot know it.
When I knew ardor and elation.
When I was but a tiny boy!
When I was gone three years, and wandered 
When I was young — a mere suggestion ...”
When Tanya’s tender message came;
When a fine lady seeks to win me 
When all the foreign cooks were bent 
When all went out to say farewell,
When at my mistress’ feet I lay
When at my tasks of charity.
When dawn’s fiirst ray had barely shown;
When destiny brought us together?
When evening comes he will repair.
When every walk fresh wonders yields;
When guests are there, she says a word
When guests arrive she pays no heed.
When he had come, and if, of late.
When he lies deaf to your appeal?
When he was calling on an aunt 
When his hot fingers touch her hand.
When his poor head began to ache;
When in the banquet-hall he beamed 
When in the springtime I would dally
When into the hushed study came 
When mutely on your brink I pondered
When on the grass in Spring it’s pressed,
When on the ground you see him, stricken. 
When once again, inspired, ecstatic,
When once the breath of spring assails me, 
When passion’s fires no longer smolder,
When scarce a lad, his heart was captured —
When shall I meet the girl at last
When she can only throw cold water 
When springtime’s sun shines warm above: 
When suddenly they’re visited
When sweetly through the doors and surely 
When the cool messenger of morning.
When the deep shades of night are thinning:
When there’s no duty on the wine?
When they discussed some weighty matter,
When they employed the mother-tongue;
When two feet tripped toward their lover! 
When we see him nearing us.
When we were bowed beneath the rod 
When we were young, we did not tarry.’ ”
When will you lose remembrance of them?
When with diaphanous pale light
When writing his extravaganzas
When writing that intelligent,
When, a Lyceum lad, I flourished.
When, wrapped in storm, shall I be battling
Where’er it goes, I am its lover:
Where’s youth (the rhyme comes glibly) banished? 
Where I can . . .” "Ah, another pretty
Where I would loll, without a goal, 
Where Russia’s czar was king of kings.
Where Tanya’s met with ”oh-s” and ”ah-s,” 
Where Tanya met him face to face.
Where Thalia as she’s gently napping 
Where all is silent, dark and drear.
Where are the storms of love and longing.
Where did her sister take her grief?
Where did she learn this wild excess?
Where entertainment was but scant;
Where go, you madman, to forget?
Where guests disperse, or at a ball!
Where he had met her ravished gaze.
Where is compassion, where confusion?
Where is he? Y'es, I know the one.”
Where is the burning agitation.
Where is the noble aspiration.
Where is the saturnine betrayer,
Where is your Mend?” the hostess said;
Where lindens hide the lovers well;
Where long my buried heart has lain.
Where love burned like a living coal.
Where moonlight silvered shrub and stone, 
Where old Neva’s gray waters flow,
Where she, with God knows who for neighbors.
Where should I seek a dearer treasure?
Where spelling has been sadly spited,
Where still the bloody ghost pursued.
Where the maids sang to keep from cheating
Where the quick sunbeams on it play,
Where to, God knows; she never said.
Where will my naughty lad repair?
Where winds and tempests were forbidden,
Where winter-long you were so gay;
Where you were born, or, as a beau.
Where, in the shadow of the wings.
Where, on a rustic bench at last
Where, set in alphabetic order.
Whereby the mind or heart is shaken.
Wherein agreeable vice prevails.
Wherever there is Russian ground.
Which he declaims with ecstasy
Which nowadays seems somewhat queer.
Which ripens fairly, but to drop;
Which told him that his uncle lay 
While Cicero could scarcely please;
While I lie lapped in rural peace!
While doctors hemmed and women cried.
While in due time Monsieur replaced her,
While in the doorway took his station —
While in the garden’s lavish shade 
While into town the milkmaid presses, 
While our sad rhymesters earn a kick?"
While round the tents that nomads raise
While the dull husband, fully knowing 
While we, with married life not smitten. 
While wildly aU the fiddles sing
While winter’s carpet, softly shining.
While with his clumsy Russian hammer
While, on the other hand, his wife
Whispers an outworn compliment,
White hand he swiftly smoothed his hair, 
Whither Onegin in a flurry
Who’s had three thousand years of praise.
Who best knows how to separate.
Who by the high gods’ will is fated
Who called him everything that’s vicious 
Who cannot feel: he is too clever.
Who does not drain the brimming cup,
Who early found both death and glory.
Who fathered the vast universe.
Who hear November at the gate.
Who is inspired in his distress:
Who likes a bribe as much as meat.
Who loves you more may write yet more.”
Who neither crack nor are a joke!
Who never longed and never hated.
Who sees the dark on every hand?
Who taught her how to be so lavish
Who thought our Eugene was a gull;
Who tmto every fascinator
Who vanished like the shades of dawn . . .
Who was the fair young poet’s slayer?”
Who will assent to all we say?
Who will not seek our faults to flout us?
Who will not spread vile lies about us? 
Who will not weary us, with speed?
Who will recall my poor creations.
Who will supply our every need?
Who would not tire of threats and rages,
Who would not weary of evasion.
Who, in this cool majestic woman.
Who, lulling reason, comes to rest
Who, yawning, with his friends and wife.
Whoever you may be, my reader,
Whole families of neighbors driving
Whom fame had, by strange chance, been sunning.
Whom silence was about to throttle,
Whom you have found so interesting?
Whom, at the start of our romance,
Whose days are living poetry —
Whose heart belonged to other days.
Whose heart experience has chilled,
Whose hearts the years at length anneal; 
Whose peasants live in beggary;
Whose posture was of one defeated.
Whose satisfactions were, through life, 
Whose secret solace on the heart
Whose shade across the mill-pond lies 
Whose soul was shaped in Gottingen, 
Why do you pay me these attentions? 
Why don’t I travel with a crutch.
Why is Tatyana an offender?
Why is he here? Who is he? Task him!
Why not, like that poor Tula man.
Why not? You can have no objection.
Why set two ages thus at odds?
Why should you have such veneration
Why thus dispense with lawful labor?
Wili cure the lad, for good or ill.
Will be the subject of my story.
Will bravely face the stake, nor wax 
Will feel her heart with pity burning.
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Will it no more return to me?
Will look with scorn on my distress!
Will love again. But self-control,
Will not debate and ponder it
Will not your soul be filled with rue
Will square accounts, whoever falls.
Will tell the story of your fate.
Will you not come to shed a tear
Wilno. His brother went to Constantinople and after- 
Wind-tossed, and all too soon decay.
Wine of the Don, to drink a toast.
Winter, the sorceress, ’tis she!
With Eugene, and with him alone.
With French it’s spotted like a leopard —
With Lensky’s fate is occupied;
With Ozerov’s grave lines and tragic. 
With a French volume in her hand.
With a feigned chill in look and voice. 
With a fine mind and handsome face;
With a gay jest and words untrue.
With a too wanton kind of fun.
With all a dandy’s mind can limn.
With anguish, pour out at your feet 
With ardent words, and how to ravish 
With blotted rhyme and criss-cross kiss — 
With caution through the key -hole spying
With chairs and chests and casseroles,
With chalk. No knock can ever waken 
With cocks in cages (these one slaughters
With dancing blood, with living heat.
With dignity brings forth his lay.
With drooping head and languid bearing
With easy grace of this and that.
With ecstasy, but with regret.
With every church in bright attire.
With every jealous word he reckoned,
With fiery imagination.
With flame that fails as it appears;
With flashing eyes Onegin rises
With flattering pen and heart aglow.
With foreign words; their frequency 
With frowning brow he would be sitting 
With her Onegin at her side —
With her neat monogram in wax.
With him the humble road of life.
With his last victory, awaited 
With his own pawn takes his own rook.
With his own self dissatisfied.
With his red belt and sheepskin coat.
With his sardonic comedies;
With hope, then prove it an illusion,
With its unseasonable strife 
With jams and featherbeds and bowls.
With jealousy revive it next.
With joy the contemplative soul!
With kindly hand the old man’s bays.
With lampions bright on sills and ledges
With laughter and with noisy sport.
With lowered horns, a lonely deer;
With most folk, custom’s rule prevails.
With most polite and cool address,
With motley figures: people dart
With noisy haste the throng decamps;
With none to understand or cherish
With olden days and doddering nurses:
With other children scarcely ever.
With other days come other dreams,
With perfect fireedom she receives him;
With pipe alight you’d find me sipping
With proud perukes and red-heeled shoes.
With pure devotion, knew no bliss 
With rebel will and lively mind.
With roaming flocks was lightly spotted;
With rosy light the eastern skies,
With sails and rich thick traflic crowded,
With scorn; yet smiles upon the lips 
With shouts and plaudits. Tanya now 
With sighs I think, bemused adorer,
With silver hoar, the meadows lie . . • 
With skill and passion, touch and smile.
With solemn gait and sparkling eye.
With sorrow, but her tears were brief.
With splendor unaccustomed eyes.
With stormy passion’s heat she blazes;
With studied ways amused the crowd
With sudden passion, sudden pain . . .
With tea and jam, and endless tattle
With the avow'als of a boy.
With the coarse salt of malice, while 
With the ninth wave the ship’s arriving
With them, a red-wigged man in glasses:
With those Chateaubriand could write;
With two or three bright -backed imported 
With us, but grows apace; indeed, 
With utmost speed Onegin dresses,
With whirling thoughts his soul grew dizzy,
With you, nor yet with you who spin 
Within me — they have found surcease:
Within my garden, unexpected;
Within the gondola’s embrace
Within the hill -encircled valley
Within, a noisy clatter swells;
Within, you hear the feet still pounding.
Without a tavern of its own.
Without affairs, or rank, or wife,
Without them, there’s no paradise.
Worthy of him I am addressing,
Would always give three balls a year;
Would be dismayed to see him there;
Would be in every way far better 
Would chide him, would forgive him soon.
Would cite a verse he had by heart,
Would dare to seek that gentle girl?
Would dream of walking, bride and wife.
Would drop so tenderly at even . . .
Would fail to show Diana gleaming,
Would fly the place: she cannot stir;
Would gallop side by side with me!
Would grow more ardent very often,
Would he be Melmoth or Childe Harold,
Would make the den her library.
Would ravish one who prized the treasure
Would scarcely call intelligent.
Would show him every friendliness; 
Would start a quarrel quite as shrewdly, 
Would turn quite taciturn with languor, 
Would, in a body, call at eve.
Would, tete-a-tete, where no one heard.

Yes, jealousy’s attacks can seize us
Yes, now the door is opened for them,
Yet all is well — each has its due:
Yet bidding the poor girl adieu,
Yet grieve for him . . . But wherefore grieve?
Yet in vain boredom I am wasting
Yet soon they let down their defences.
Yet, as a rule, despised mankind;

You’ll grant it’s time to part, my dears.

You also, youthful belles, belated
You are an early bird! Last night
You are the helpmeet I’d be choosing:
You are to come, and named the day.”
You came and lectured me so coldly —
You came in dreams: I feared to waken,
You care to? Check accounts, or drink,
You dwell in dreams, and you persist 
You handsome albums decorated
You haunts where I might stay in hiding. 
You have a Russian family setting,
You have a fever . . .” "Fever, no:
You hear amid the gay street’s fluster
You in my fond imagination . . .
You knew Ruslan and fair Ludmila;
You knew the answer — as you say: 
You know the truth? What is the use 
You know; besides, all lots were equal 
You lectured me, I listened, meek;
You looked in at the house just twice
You made me drunk in other days.
You may dismiss them as unfit
You may expect no less firom me;
You may rely upon the fair,
You men who lived in wedded bliss
You might be pleased — if so, advise me —
You mothers, as your own once did.
You prove you know, beyond a doubt,
You rustic Priams, and you gentle
You scarce can get a dish of pottage:
You seek: be it extravaganzas 
You shone as with a nuptial splendor:
You should perceive udth eye severe 
You sigh, and think with farrowed brow —
You smooth his pillow and contrive
You spend your time, I’d like to know?”
You spoke, my very soul was shaken.
You still retain the memory 
You too, farewell, my curious neighbor.
You venerator of the Muse
You who will smooth in after days
You witness of that fallen glory.
You woodlands where I used to roam,
You, dreams of sacred poesy?
You, figments of sweet reverie.
You, readers, with another tale:
You, you alone would be my wife.
Young Olga coming to make tea,
Young Olga was the first to stir;
Young Tanya, whom I still hold dear.
Young girls, in passing, hushed their chatter;
Young love, because it is so blind,
Young timid love, and that was shocking. 
Your Grandison?” "I can’t remember —
Your Madam Larina’s, I find,
Your Olga’s face, so round and blooming.
Your Olga? And Tatyana too?”
Your Phyllis, whom you idolize.
Your candor filled me with confusion;
Your charm? My verses sang your praise; 
Your dreams, your high simplicity.
Your frank avow-al touched me nearly.
Your friendship.” At this invitation 
Your grief wall bring me to remorse?
Your heart responded how? Pray, tell!
Your honor’s most astute defender —
Your look that made my spirit sink!
Your magic music and your skill:
Your marked seducer you discern.
Your own young days. Were you in love?”
Your pleasures with a taste more keen,
Your scorn. You did not find surprising 
Your spouse awaits; come to me, come! . . .”

Your way in soulful flight and free.

Your winter is cut out for you.

Why is he here? Who is he? Task him!

A monogram he found too mazy,
A more magnificent reward.
A namby-pamby, colorless
A nice old woman, plain but pleasant.
He Hked debate, and sometimes rudely
A nobler page, more fine and true,
He’s sent to doctors, the Neva’s
And here the regicidal dagger 
He’s killed! The fearful affirmation
He’s driven from the ball to bed:
He’s done with women, and it looks 
A novelty framed to divert him;
A pallid swarm, the patients pour:
A pampered boy, allured by pleasure.
A passing thought’s enduring trace
He’ll then resume till day is breaking
A pitch-sealed bottle they were serving 
He’d take his fascinating pen 
A place is found for every guest
He’d suffer bonds again, provided 
A pledge of every loveliness.
A poem to her on the spot.
He’d stroll into the drawing-room 
A portrait of none else but me,
A precious pledge! The man was guided
A prize that chanced to come his way:
A proper distance to allow,
He’d led a kind and simple life;
He’d have disarmed the youthful heart.
A rival, or to catch him napping.
A row of dinners, dull and sure,
A rustic view that she found fetching,
A scholar in a yellow shawl!
A second, and a third he sends,
He’d had a glimpse of his estate;
A series of fatiguing scenes.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
A shadow, or a wife, pursues
A shaggy bear! At Tanya’s cry

A simple monument is placed.

A snowdrift stirs, it falls asunder:

A soldier spouse and a campaign.
A song across the waters drifted;
A song he brings for Tanya’s pleasure.
Have your own horses pull your coaches,
A spirit brooking no dictation?
A starry host of choiring spheres 
Have they arrived? His calculations
Have there been any conflagrations?
A summer in the country, racing 
A swarm of thoughts exempt from blame.
Have seen such ladies, not a few
A tale of sentiment not new,
A talked-of novel, rather hazy,
A tavern tribune, chief of rakes.
A tedious season they await
A tender father, a good master.
Have played a prank in coquetry.
Have passed since in a hazy vision 
A thought in which he acquiesced.
A thought was born, and grew, unbidden;
A tomb, a temple vowed to love,
A torrent gray with foam is pouring;
A touch, and the sharp cliffs are beveled,
A trespasser may hope for pardon.
Have learned how hearts can be tormented.
A veritable poet, yonder.
"Your fashionable world is hateful;
A veteran W'ho never fails
A village view she seemed to know,
Have dimmed the golden coal; half-seen,
Have cards and dice; and not for naught 
A way for her; he’s happy if

A white cap shows, all in a trice:
Have been away! Before you vanish 
Have acted with intelligence.
A worthy course of action finds: 
Has thrilled by night the silent dale.
Has she the answer to the riddle
A youth, who on the snow seems dozing;
A moment since, this heart was quickened 
AU jealous thoughts evaporated —
Abandoning his pleasant village.
About her early indiscretion . . .
Has sent you, and I shall be leaning 
About his Olga; it may be.
About its magic healing fountains,
About the hills and meadows lying.
About the past, what’s done and gone; 
Has held the first place in my heart.
About the table monsters sit!
They took communion twice a year;
About this common rustic view;
About: a noisy laughing host . . . 
Above her spinning-wheel’s low rattle;
Above it all, the wild applause.
Has clothed a hopeless egoism 
Above the domes of Moscow, dazing 
Has been diluted heavily.
Abruptly down the incline bounding,
Absorbed in bitter meditation
Absorbed the girl, and she was thrown 
Accomplished as a vile coquette!
Accomplished in the end. Three cheers!

Ah, spring, fair spring, the lovers’ season,
Ah, whither, whither did you flee?

Had chased him and had quickly caught him.

All covered with the brittle snow;
All crowd into the drawing-room

Good readers: a new face arrives.
And I admit, in penitence,
Good neighbor who’s dropped in on me,
And I can’t say the clique is wrong 
And I confess I am perplexed:
And I have learned how to be meek*
And I shall speak, if you allow,
And I was just thirteen years old.
And I, all discipline refusing,
And Kura’s and Ajragva’s banks
And Lensky — Tanya; Kharlikova,
And Lensky, firm and unafraid.
And Lensky, grieving honestly,
And Lethe’s sluggish tide will swallow
And Lucifer’s hailed by the cock;
And Olenka’s. Why say them nay?”
Or it may be his martyred shade
And Strasbourg pies, imperishable;
And Tanya’s heart began to glow.
And Tanya enters. Here her prince.
And Tanya found the journey bleak.
And Turkish pipes of amber rare,
And a shy maiden’s pure caress.
Gold pines, and live Limburger cheese.
And all distraction finds her jaded,
And all exclaim delightedly
And all seemed dull. But soon the reading
And all she looked on glistened white.
And all that Paris in her passion
Goethe and Schiller were his masters.
And all their w’ayward stirrings cease, 
And all, our tender dreamer fused 
Goes out at once, demands a horse.
And always needing some correction,
And an eternal friendship plighted
And an old gentleman espied her,
God helped; complaints did not embarrass
God grant you find some trifle here
And as a child she’d romp and play
And as a rural miss appears
And as he reads, both thought and feeling
And as he says farewell again 
And as it hisses, gently steaming.
And as on these his fancy dwelt,
And as she looked about, dejected,

And brooklets murmured pleasantly,

And her head sinks. The dawn grows bolder, 
And here hussars on leave, resplendent
Away forever, was so near! . . . 
From other fires that had been hidden
plicitly to the verse of Bogdanovich, an eighteenth- 
And his cheek pale, she does not see 
From nearby hills the snow, already
And holding him in such affection
''Can it, indeed,” thinks Eugene, ''can it
And how it strikes me, never mind).
And hurriedly before it perished
And if her soul was deeply stirred,
And if that’s not enough to do,
And if the sudden sight dismayed her.
And in a voice pohte but reedy
And in an attitude confiding,
And in due time the husband passed 
And in exchange he took as well
And in her mind a billet-doux
And in her soul was resurrected
And in high London circles, they 
From hour to hour yet more enraptured
And in that far and savage spot
And in the court gay magpies screamed;
And in the crowd that filled the hovel,
And in the grave his bones have rest!”
From his affection; they were these:
And in the misty moonlight furled.
And in the sleigh most carefully
And in these nobles he would see
And integers: ourselves alone.
And into the deep forest plunges;
And is the vernal crown of youth 
And it is %^ery hard to bear
And it is precious, being brief:
From hesitancy strove to wean us.
And its cold white magnificence:
And its late sequel as absurd.
And ivory balls, not more than two.
And jealous in a frigid way.
And jealous longing frets the maid —
And kept him underneath her rule.
And know that heart will never quicken?
And lands remote, where on the breast
And lean upon it with assurance . . .
And leave the forests gaunt and harsh.
And leaves the little hovel shaking , . . 
And let his tears unheeded shower;
From here he watched with thoughtful eyes
And lightly clad, though airs were chill,
And likes the pallid evening light
And likewise do not find beguiling
And lives like a true sage at last,
And locked him in a corner where
From head to foot, in form or face.
From early youth his dedication
From distant streets where cabs were flying, 
And love is but the devil’s tool.
And loved the duties well fulfilled.
And many a solemn protestation 
And mists above the meadows brooded;
And modern man’s true soul divulging:
And more play whist, whose fame’s enduring —
And mortgaged all the land he owned.
And most, the linden-shaded ways
And murmur sing-song confidences,
A mighty music down the ages.
From all the heart holds dear, my blunder
And my own man I want to be.
And near a stream, stood calm and proud, 
From a moth-eaten almanac;
And never after that went near it.
And never loved where it desired,
And never said his passions nay.
And next he dressed . . .
And next the girl’s guitar we see;
ship and the inclemency of the climate, he returned 
And nightmares and hallucinations.
And no calumnious friend so pert
And none can hear his neighbor speak.
And not a single w^ord deleted;
And not a station will be known
And not long years of separation,
And not without a tell-tale blush.
And notes complexions, with a sneer
And nothing to remark or pardon;
And now Zaretzky measures off
And now for the first time I’m bringing
''My second?” Eugene said, "Permit me;
And now the guests, exchanging glances.
And now the one-armed prince had beckoned
And now they bring out eighteen jades.
And now what of Onegin? Truly
And now, at spring’s bright invitation.
And now, since I’ve no more to tell,
From Istamboul may not be here.
And nurses scream and children roar.
And of repeating platitudes,
And of the glorious days of old,
And offer hospitality.
And oh, they are a weary weight!
And old companions, dull and vicious;
And on Caucasian cliffs how often.
And on her lips a careless smile.
And on her shoulder leans his head;
And on the last page this reflection:
And on the lovage dropped a tear.
From Eugene: he was far too jaded —
And once I gave my meager all
Friends, for the poet you are grieving,
And one may find a mirror lying
And one thing more put us asunder —
And one would find the children roaming
And other cares, severe, distressing,
When guests are there, she says a word
And pen; good night.” Her single taper
And people later, with a frown,
And pity took the place of anger.
And plait his humble footgear there.
And pleading first that by-and-by
And pleasant though it is to roam.
Regards. But Olga, oh, my friend, \ ou 
And ponder each move’s secret meaning.
And praise Odessa’s gardens greatly.
And presses her soft hand — elation
And pride that ever looks askance.
French turns will please me in a sentence
And promised them each year again
And prompts something satirical;
And purr the while: Tatyana saw
And puts her little hand at length 
And quite as faithless as their feet.
And raise love’s value cleverly;
And raised his nose above the rest.
And raises fowls, while at his knee
And rash the question that she broaches:
''Princesses ’Tachettel I can’t believe it!”
And resolute, she shipped the peasant
And rightly, but his pain was such
And rightly: for Onegin, sitting
And roam the sea’s expanse, unpent.
And roamed its gardens at my ease,
And rootless dreams that could not last,
And round the loaded carriage crowded,
And sadly, virginally sighing,
Freely the poet spoke and truly,
''Then I was younger, maybe better,
And seat the two friends hastily.
Framed somberly by gentlemen.
And sees the gaping fiends of hell:
And send them, armed, from Led at dawn,
And sentimentally devoted
And sentinel to sentinel 
And served each course to them by rank.
And setting up a new regime;
Four steps toward a narrow bed.
And sharing leisure, thoughts, and food,
Found nothing fit to fill his life.
And she will learn my knowledge of
And she, not knowing men are heartless,
And show commercial enterprise.
And shrewdly held his peace; in sport
And shun the heart that would be tender.
And silently recall the past?
Found a white picture to surprise her:
Forward, with groan and grunt he lunges,
And sinks from sight, soon to be crumbling. 
And sleep at last her boon conferred;
And sleighing, and, when light grew dimmer,
And slept beside her every night.
And slowly by a secret network
And smoothly glide on polished boards; 
And snoring, heavy Pustyakov 
And so God grant them health and cheer!
And so all hail to you, nine Muses, etc.”
And so for days poor Tanya broods.
And so from idle talk she flies.
And so he’ll rifle keener minds;
And so her quick imagination
And so inflexible their virtue.
And so of course the girl decided
And so the bumptious guild denies him;
Forgive the tears you wring from me,
played Shakespearean roles and acted in the tragedies 
And so they aged, like all things mortal,
And so was captured by the French —
And so without more words, departed;
And so, my home was then Odessa . . .
Forgive me, then, for thus retreating. 
Forgetting friends and city ways
A man of sense, I am conceding,
And sometimes neatly made retort.
And soon the east will be alight;
And soon their tongues begin to race.
And sooth, I fled these haughty belles 
And stares unseeing, in no hurry
And staring in dismayed surprise,
Forced me to tear my heart away;
And steamed herself on Saturday —
And steps across; her Mood congeals;
And still our Eugene lies abed
And stop defenceless in the field.
XI The local gentry’s round of pleasure
And such a crowd, a perfect rabble . .
Forbidden fruits alone entice —
For, sad to say, she loved another:
And swift to flee from fun and folly,
For worldly shows and vanities.
And tears of reconciliation
And tedious planned holidays.
For woman is a tender fool,
And terror-stricken would await
And that between her teeth, to greet 
And that for many a long day.
And that it cheated us again;
And the cool yawns that come amain. 
And the deep seas His praise rehearse
Because he could make no bon mot.
And the grave eyes that have undone me
And the improvement will be splendid! 
And the long evenings black as ink.
For trousers^ dress-coat^ and for vest;
For though the country boasts no palace,
And the poor girl is roused betimes
A man of rank, his worthy father
And the same pom, and the same spouse, 
For there’s a lack of taste in us.
And the two friends for death competing, 
And the word’s new — should not be great.
For the wild steppes’ barbaric tongues,
And the young city miss who’s facing
And then appeared a row of glasses.
And then at home all day he stays
And then once more till noon sleep sound.
And then sat silent for the nonce.
And then the wayward course of passion. 
And then, refreshed after a dipping,
And then, with Olga, how he acted!
And there’s a witch with a goatee,
And there a traveler from a distance,
And there beside the rocky shallows
For the most costly merchandise 
parfaitement comme ilfauV^
And there the weary ploughmen dally.
And there were those who said they knew
And they delight to see it flow.
And thin, but pretty, more or less;
And think of it! So timid is he,
And this routine was to his taste.
And those I do not greatly me;
And though he was an ardent rake,
And though the talk of my yotmg friend
And thought he met with no rebuff.
And thought, I do not doubt, of me.
And through the frosty window-pane
For the first time in any novel
And thunderous, flock eagerly:
And thus reduce him to confusion;
And time would pass, and there would be
And to a humble cottage dashes:
And to his stand the cabby goes.
For the cotillion begs her hand.
And to put finis to their chatter;
And to the final pages turning.
And took his medal for a toy
And treading toes, between the chairs 
For the United Slavs recruited.
For such mere trifles? Why repine 
And trusted her with house and pelf,
And tucked away, an almanac
And tunnels under water, too.
And turn the meadow to a marsh 
For such a life, I am afiraid.
For six weeks yearly be a mess, a 
For ravings that it may induce.
And vainer labor there is none —
And valleys, trees, and hamlets seemed 
And virtue won its due reward.
And visit at the Christmas season,
For just those little slips of grammar;
For it is late, the shortest way;
And wake the birds in beech and larch.
And walk him in the afternoon.
And was at Olga’s ere he knew it!
And watch her, languidly enchanted!
And watch life’s furrows briefly nourish
And watch the failing of his breath,
And wdth a heart for love designed,
And what a throat! And what a spirit! . . .
A lyre that bears a little dove;
And what the fashions were that fall.
And what the moon might signify.
And what was my amazement, finding
For if they sing, they can’t be eating
For honor could require no less.
For him one moral had to teach;
For here, Napoleon, elated
And when they entered, arm in arm,
And when we find our old devotion 
A loaf is proffered, coins are taken,
For he is welcome everywhere.
And where he left a lasting trace.
And where indeed of her they’re prating.
''What notions! You may find it blameless.
For gossip is not held a crime.
And where the youthful galaxy
And where two pines their shadows fling
For glory will be hers, and treasure!”
And while my wanton muse rejoices
And while the breakfast is preparing
And while the world in silence slept.
And while they all are in high feather,
And whispering, make quite a stir:
And who, then, came to our assistance
And whom shall we confide in, pray?
And whom we kiss as they expect,
For friendship’s sake would I were writing
And will accustom us to grammar;
And window -sashes rattled loudly.
The chilly dark the girl is sharing
And with a somber splendor shone
And with enamored eyes to see
And with good cheer and merry sally
For four long years she had been ailing.
For epigrams, and was annoyed 
And with strange languor fill my blood!
And with the malice time imposes.
And with the spark of a bon mot
And without foolish affectation.
And wore — her last defences down —
And wore the funeral wTeath at last.
For epigrams it would be splendid . . .
For dreams, and would have been a shame.
And yet her face was pale and clouded
For carefree youth knows no regret.
For as it is, my style is peppered
And yet she found it no affliction —
And yet the auguries perplex her.
And yet win luster from my writing;
And yet, were morals not in question,
And you shall judge me as you may.
For all your great gifts and your least, 
And you, can you remain the same?
For all through Russia there will run 
And you, my fair ideal, too,
And you, my reader, wise and witty.
And you, oh, youthful inspiration,
And you, skilled pupils of Levshin,
For all the efforts she is making.
And your remarkable collection
And, careless of the cold, is training
For all that musty rhetoric.
And, fortune’s darling, in his rhyming
For all her future social cares 
For a long time . . . indeed, forever.
For a few books, a wilderness
And, with no aim on which to fix,
For Petersburg’s no sleepyhead.
Angel or fiend, as you prefer.
Anisya surely won’t ignore them;
Anna’s reign, Annibal, who had incurred Biihren’s 
place opposite her at the table; she falls asleep, and 
Announce the coming of his bales.
Announces it is dinner-time.
For Olga’s album — not a bit!
Another’s grief is hers to rue,
For Lensky, the cotillion seemed 
Another’s, and his memory 
For 1808 without a binding:
For (as I’ve said) there he must sit 
Another day: he still is dumb;
Another demon seizing me,
Another landowner come newly
Foot it neatly on the green!
Another set of lines transpired 
Another, at a god’s dictation.
Anticipating this distraction.
Apart, Tatyana can but linger
Aplomb, he lifts his eye-glass, stares
Appeal, complaint, confession, sobbing 
Appears, his broom in hand, still blinking;
Fly, my darlings, run away.
Approach!” How calm and cold their faces.
Approached her pillow, she would raise 
He looked more crestfallen than regal
Fluff up her hair as style commands.
Fluff in his hair, with visored cap
Flows down in muddy streams and steady
Are charming, friends, but I would put
Flings wide the door; his caftan’s torn,
Fling him currants ripe and red.
Are dazzling, and rejoice our hearts.
Flames up, the embers glow again 
Five centuries are all we need 
Are glad at last to take a rest:
Are guarding fur-coats faithfully;
Are here cast off, or so the flighty 
Are here, with scissors straight and curved. 
First, memory would trace the features,
Are just the same as what they were; 
Are lulled to sleep, and readily 
Are quite forgot- The path is now 
Are quite perplexed by such as she:
Are roaring the recitative.
Are settled: they are fast asleep;
Are such a man would rather bleed
Are turned by one cool glance to ice,
Are waltzing round the dancing-floor.
Are you a guardian angel to me?
A lily of the valley blowing
Aroused your pity then . . . You’re kneeling 
First snow, and delicately wrote 
As Eugene, by regrets distracted.
As I am, too, a little rest:
As I fared onward gloomily,
As I her rustic charms survey.
First let us prick his vanity
First glory, and then wealth and rank.
As a good comrade, one who shares 
As at a mighty funeral feast;
As custom bade; with charm and spell 
As did the bard — yet not aquiver
As did this author: chief of all 
As do the sins of years long fled 
As does proud Moscow, in its rights.
As erstwhile comes, to hum an air
A lexicon of snobbery
As fancy in the lot would trace 
First at the desk, with lamp unlighted.
First Spain was rocked by storm, and, second.
First Eugene, still advancing duly.
When mutely on your brink I pondered
As he was followed by the blues.
As her good nurse w^ould have her do:
Fine ladies, military fops.
As his repellent aid he proffers;
As in a nightmare each one aims
As infant slumbers, as the moon
As many wiles as I could mention 
Finding my youthful dream come true —
As my confession. Why say more?
As on a shaky bench he lays her.
A letter heartfelt, artless, candid;
As one who fought forgotten wars
As one who through a fog is peering,
As only passion can have wrought.
Fie finds suflScient occupation
As rock and wave, or ice and flame.
Fell at her feet, his heart contracted;
As she surveyed him . . . His dejected 
As some time later to assert
Fed by his slipper or review.
As that of one beneath a spell.
As the dark coverts were denuded;
As the two foes, with even tread.
As though a chiQy hand were laid
Fate guarded Eugene, our young waster;
As though she feared an inquisition
As though there were a tacit ban
Fat merchants, Cossacks, boulevards,
As upon any other day.
As well as write; and how he bowed!
Farewell, you friendly skies of home;
As years went by, and readily
As you discover life’s allures,
As, my Onegin, I drop you.
Far back to a lost spring, and we.
Ashamed to own his every feature;
Ashore at last, and our endeavor 
Aside all timid thoughts, forgetting 
Askance at fair, unwonted faces,
Asked what Onegin’s visit meant,
Asked who she was, set straight his wig,
Asleep j&rom boredom?” "Not at all.”
At Carnival in savory cheer,
At Christmas, carols were their pleasure;
At Europe’s dainty handicraft,
xlvii But now my fate is quite decided.
Familiar hills, familiar alleys.
At any gathering or dance,
At bottom, and, too bored to think.
At cards with his inheritance!
Fair ladies who are sentimental —
Fair Nina Voronskaya, who
A laugh would bring the pair together?
At dusk the samovar is gleaming
At either end the two friends stand.
At everything she gazes on;
At fifteen feet: his aim was good.
At first Eugene began to dream
At first Madame controlled the child;
At first but wept and tore her hair.
At first disturbed me, in the end 
At first these were but machinations
At giddy feasts and wild discussions,
xliv The hopes of old will not be granted.
At him . . . And if she was amazed,
At home his pistols claimed attention;
'Tn all the jealous crowd, what she
At last he rouses, opens wide
Extolling you in tones of fire!
At last, by night, arrived the snow*
At least of some complaint arthritic?
At least, if pity seemed to soften
At length our hollow-hearted hero
Ye vanished tumults, rest in peace!
At noisy gatherings and after.
At once he offered with a smirk
At once that guests might be expected.
At once the slanderer to defy.
At once, and bear the weapon -case.
At peace, it is my artless pleasure
At slaughter, with a heart of leather . . .
At table, ’neath the damask cover.
At that she could no longer hide
At the age of eighteen Annibal was sent by the
At the back porch in readiness,
At the casino cosily;
Expressing the discrimination,
At the gay spectacle turned hollow. 
Exhibiting the present age,
'Why can’t the devil take you now?’ ”
At thirty profitably wed.
'^'^Tell me your dream,” all breathlessly
At times she pays him no attention;
At twenty to the fashion bred,
At whiles, upon their elbow's leaning,
Aunt Pelageya still possesses
Ausonia’s happy sons are trilling 
Avails to rouse him: he is gone.
Exceptions may be hard to find,
of cabbage.
Except the stomach; I may mention 
Away, his profile may be seen ...”
Away, the good old sleigh, at last. 
Away, while the old sleigh was mended 
Awhile all conversation ceases;
Ay is risky, if delicious;
Ay, when, foaming gold, it hisses . . .
Examine Tanya silently
A kitchen and a fence below.
xliv You did not like me . . . That was bitter.
A kindred soul, he held, was burning
Bare steppe is all you will behold;
Bared silently, as in a dream.
Baroness Barbara von Kriidener; St. Preux and Wol- 
Bassoon and flute at once are heard.
Even the pistol and the sword.
Be fact, and can my spring be past 
Be patient, then, as with a brother:
Be quick! Drive on!” he bids the peasant;

Be thou my staffs nor let me stray.

Because my husband’s decoration,
Because rash ardor and quick wit
Even a man of honor: thus
Because the tune is so diverting,
A housewife seems a perfect treasure!
Because there was not much to pay,
Because they lacked — hadn’t one heard? — 
Because your honor and your pride 
Because, between the lines before him. 
Her rosy innocence and grace.
Befits and pleases you and me?”
Before a storm; I wanted, too,
Even Didelot becomes a bore.”
Before her door; he waits for her;
Before her now, without a doubt:
Before him, loud with seething trajfl&c,
Before it’s heard, is grave and quiet.
Before the altar, head cast down.
Before the threshing-floor, thick willows 
Before they halted at a gateway 
Before whom my bold lyre is muted,
Before, her bow was as serene.
Europe has spurious wines to offer;
Eugene, more tolerant than many.
Beheld the bed where all must lie,
Behind a hill the moon is hidden;
Behind a stump among the trees
Eugene, as he his turn awaited.
Behind the mill they went straightway.
Behind the strange bed’s silken curtain
Behold each generation flourish,
Behold the Russian tents in ranks.
Behold! from town arrives — what rapture!
Eugene was not alone in noting
Beholding bareness everywhere.
Belong to youth, with youth are fled.
Beloved ... or such was his conviction,
Below that other’s signature
Eugene should not have been so rash.
Below, though it is early yet,
Eugene perused the sad epistle;
Beneath her pillow. Darkness keeps 
Beneath his fingers would have hurled 
Beneath it: d. v. Annette”;
Eugene had long abominated
Beneath the Finnish sky, alone.
Beneath the light of stars and lamps.
Beneath the prudent flag of peace.
Beneath the shade of his acacias
Beneath their sky he plucked his lyre,
Benedetta sia la madre: a Venetian baracarolle.
Beshtau, the sharp-peaked, the eternal
Eugene flings wide the door: defenseless.
Beside his heavy mate is lying.
Beside his wife, that chubby charmer.
Beside my quiet lake, beset 
Beside that most superb of creatures,
Beside that stream with shadows laced
Beside the fire a table’s set.
Eugene berates them, rolls his eyes.
Eugene alone was framed to measmre
Beside the window. So life passes . . .
Beside the window; on the pane 
Best leeches send him to the spas.
Betrayed — he took a welcome rest. 
Eugene alone goes home to sleep.
Betrays my stomach, and although 
'^And happiness, before it glided
Between a rascal and a bore;
Between her hours of toil and leisure
Between two aunts, beside a post,
Bewildering the wretched man.
Beyond the grave, yes, at the end 
Beyond, the Caucasus’ tall masses,
Beyond, the plain, with hamlets dotted,
Birch, linden, aspen, all are bare;
Black chasm were gaping at her feet . . . 
'^Come now, my child, it’s time: get up.

Bloomed like a flower in the shade;
Bore to the grave to sleep forever 
Born of a liar in an attic.
Both carriages and people flounder.
Both friends and foes (they’re ail the same).
Both love and malice scarce recalling, 
Both tongue and seal are pink, are dry.
Bottles of cellar-cooled light wine:
Bowed lower, sought to catch her eye;
'^Who? That fat general, you mean?”
'nine,’ and to sacrifice one of the final stanzas:
Briefly surveying every tier.
(A friendly glass, and friendly chatter
Built by the fishermen was flaring.
Bumps down Tverskaya Street already.
But Eugene’s sole preoccupation
But Eugene, now his friend was gone, 
But I’m a dunce! They bade me say
But I became another’s wife;
(As I in jest so oft asserted)?
But I grow old, and memory fails;
(As was the case, upon my honor.
But I, my friend, am not contending

But Tanya does not share our pleasure.
But Tanya had no tears at all;
But Tanya, dreaming, hardly hears,
But Tasso’s murmured octaves are,
But all too soon the summer ends.
But are those stirrups he is hearing?

But as the rural dusk advances
Eugene Onegin: Chapter Two
But at her window, fain to weep.
But at the late and sterile season,
But bears refreshment and renewal —
But brings to mind our fading years 
But business holds the greater part.
But by rule only, and he doted
But by some influence despotic.
Onegin fires . . . oh, hapless men.
But by your will; my fate* s decided;
But curious, as maidens are,
But dinner’s served, and arm in arm
But drops it without more ado.
But ere ’tis open, fades and crumbles.”
Onegin heard the sweet confession
But ever sadder, ever fonder.
But fast or slow, leave town behind!
But fiery youth cannot dissemble
Ivii I too made it my occupation
But first he answers: ’’Agafon.”
Onegin leaned above the river
But for my part I do not mind
Eugene Onegin: Chapter Three
But for one thing he had a bent,
Once more forsakes society.
But from the ones we love and trust,
But have a warm, frank welcome for you.
But he refuses; he’s preparing
But he will back you while you live,
But heedlessly; she cannot school
But her good husband loved her dearly,
But her soul aches, and nothing pleases.
But here’s our lady unattended.
But here is tea: the girls demurely
But his grave illness, I confess,
One cherished fancy for another
One clownish fellow, idly leaning
But in my youth no one engaged 
But in parenthesis I mention:
But in their praises why be stringing
But it is late, he should be leaving;
But it was not capitulation
But journeys made in wintry weather
One day when leading his battalion.
But keep to their familiar ways:
But knew the most amusing stories
But left alone, Onegin sighed.
But left him bored to a degree,
But let us rather now inquire
But like a shadow moves about,
But listens with an absent smile.
But lo! from out the morning valley
But love grew greater, unreqmted;
But naught avails her girlish wrath;
One foot upon the floor is planted.
But never mind, let’s rather hurry
One has a cock’s head plain to see,
One heard the crickets’ slender choir.
But no, our paths have separated.
But none as yet came near divining
But nothing hurts when you are playing;
But nothing offers consolation.
But now . . . the tombstone and its story
One hears the clicking of a cock.
But now a kind and simple father,
But now adieu, oh, golden playtime!
But now all minds are fogged and cloudy,
But now her reason and her will 
But now it’s time for the ballet.
But now the blue of evening darkens.
One is a horned and dog-faced creature,
But now, ’tis as a house forsaken.
But now, enough, have done; for you
But now, the prey of evil passion,
One saw the cheerful morning smile;
But other fancies, dark and chill.
But our Onegin’s heart was stricken
One takes a risk in such discussion,
But reasonable conversation.
But scarce did consciousness forsake him
But seeing Olga wouldn’t read ’em.
But she had heard of them a dozen
But she in whom my thoughts are rooted.
But she prepared a conflagration.
But she took fright, our shy Tatyana;
But she was slow of wit at best.
But silent as a sage he sat
One thing alone he loved, he breathed;
But soon was yawning while he raced:
Eugene Onegin: Chapter Six
But stepping forth she slips and tumbles;
On elegance her mind w^as bent.
But tenderness his look did show.
But that is not my pleasure now.
But that the wedding was deferred
But the discussions I have heard, 
But the proud princess, cold and serious,
But the provincial town affords 
But the sad ruin brought no sigh
But then he never read a page.
But then he paused, and with his narrow
On every single suitor’s hopes?
But there’s no need that I dissemble
But there’s no rule that has not any:
But they demand a madrigal!
But this bright sibilant potation
But this gay circle I deserted.
But those good friends who were insistent
But though Onegin’s peace forsake him
But though the arguments are keen,
But tiresome ghosts. Can we unmask him? 
But to endure I need one boon —
But to the garden let us race
But was true joy to Eugene granted 
But what availed her urgent passion?
But what w^as further to transpire 
On everything and everyone:
On foreign scenes to feast our eyes;
But where is my disjointed story?
On hearing this, Zaretzky started
On horseback; such close friends were they 
But who does that is only choosing
But wishes them away with speed.
But with a new interpretation,
But with the living truth aglow,
But worldly quarrels breed the dread
But worse, what now you choose to do!
But wretched is the man who never
But years went rolling by, and then
On other paths, since youth is spent,
But yielding to a dream’s distraction,
But you’re already dressed! God save me.
But you, Bordeaux, I always treasure
A horn rang out, as in a dream;
physiologist; Tissot: a French historian of the period.
But, Lord, before the evening’s ended 
On plucking the two-headed eagle 
But, every interruption spurning,
On scenes both various and motley.
But, gentlemen, you may decline
A holy secret, and a voice 
But, lacking them, the joy’s diminished;
But, like a man of worth and sense,
But, rain or shine, each day his coach is
Buyanov’s hand she has refused,
Buyanov leads off Pustyakova;
By Fate’s imperious decree.
By God! I wish I could retract.
By Lensky and his love; light flashes;
By a dark hope of what might be.
A heart that had not felt a pang —
By a slim icicle united.
By a sly dodge or ready jape.
By a translated move or word,
By afternoon he will be waking.
By an assumed austerity;
Or kiss the hem of her dear dress.
By candle-light she rose and dressed.
By chance, these verses have not perished;
By dinner, tea, and supper merely.
By dreams of a far country shaken.
By facile conquest swiftly tired.
By grandmammas and grandpapas.
On sentiment we draw the curtain;
By hate and dread, and strongly beat 
By her dull partner’s mood infected;
By honor’s dictates, was indeed 
By ladies in society . . .
A haughty skeleton, and that
By mental effort tranquilizing
By mocking glance or chilly word,
By new desires I am enchanted.
By night, in dalliance, sweeter far.
By nothing stirred, where all is dim.
By now the wine of poesy
By one emotion only stirred;
By one persistent thought he’s haunted.
By poetry and love, or sickened 
Eugene Onegin: Chapter Seven
By solitude nowise dejected;
By some obscure presentiment.
By someone awkward and afraid.
He did not stir, but like one dreaming
By thaw and grimy steps defaced.
Of youthful pranks and childish pleasures, 
By the still stream, with dusk descending.
By the young Olga’s winning ways,
By this delightful counsel guided,
By this most black and vengeful mood? 
By those whose parts are not extensive?
By tiresome rhymes and vain regret,
Off in a narrow lane, at last.
By what Tolstoy’s fine brush created.
Off in the cotmtry we can say
Off to the ball as is required,
By worldly approbation paid.
By your good friend, all without guile,
Calash^ kibitka, crowded sleigh.
Call it magnetic or hypnotic.
Can a man do? Go walking there?
Can be surprised, who is not stirred 
A haughty general after her.
Can it be she who only now
Off to the country promptly packed her,
Can only curse his wedding-day!
Can shovel silver with a spade;
Offended vanity or spleen?
Can this be she who long since wrote —
Can you, so generous, so keen.

Oh, horror! Better far to stay

A cosmopolitan — or what?

A halcyon bucolic scene,
Can it be that Tatyana truly

By what is his cold torpid soul
By too-sweet tea, the ladies’ meekness, 
By the Neva it may be you

By grove and stream and field and steep — 
But, feeling the blind archer’s sting,
But, Muse, you must forget the past.
On past the bright parterre, the lawn.

But where no more one meets his face . . .

But no! — straight down the steps to meet him
But never mind the turn you gave me;
One finger’s frostbitten, of course.
But just to tease your appetite;
But in a corner who is standing,
But hush! Our sternest critic rises
But for that sermon do not think
Once more Tatyana’s heart is drumming;
But for my wretched fate preserving

But first, what dark delight you cherish, 
But even then, and more’s the pity,
Onegin grips his pistol tightly,
Onegin fumbles as he seeks 
Onegin flies to taste the blisses
But by the window she would brood
Onegin comes, apologizing.
Onegin a pure rapture felt.

A horrid shout assails the walls
Betrayed no anger, no surprise 
Beside the stanza all unfinished
Beside the fire and hum to it 
Beside a stream, or on a hill.
Beneath my Afric’s sunny sky,
Eugene himself with eyes that burned
Beneath her pillow, empty playthings;
Below you see the river wind
Eugene was apt at keeping still;
Beholding Lensky. ^^Well?” Forthrightly
Behind the curtain’s funeral fold
Begins to raise his pistol coolly.
Begged that her husband sniffer her
Before her charge, whose eyes were full.
Because society’s conventions,
Be sentenced by a crooked jury 
Bat have one things when you were gone^
A land imagination hallows:
Away with Olga, nothing loth;
Away already: without fail.
At this unlucky moment, we
At the spinet, then swiftly quitting 
At the sad turning of the years,
At the commencement of my story
At last she rose, and gently sighing
At last for whom her heart is yearning 
At heart, giving a single jot.
'T cannot sleep, nurse; it is stifling!
At dawn, by Cytherea’s light.
At dawn tomorrow, near the mill;
At a soiree. '^God! to see her! . . .
As, sped like arrows from the bow.
Farewell! Forever, or for years?”
Farewell, proud palace! But why wait?
As wild as they: forsook her songs 
As through the dust his horses fare.
As though he’s surely done with books.
Fate had arranged it otherwise.
Fate plans a different conclusion . . .
Fear of censorship seems to have been a minor factor; 
As suddenly grew timorous,
Feeling and thought with music’s strain.
As she says gently: ^^Rise; have done.
As perfect as an illustration —
Find life a function to endure.
As men need air, they found kvass needful,
As hermits live who hope for heaven
As he depicted their delights;
As he comes near; it’s no illusion:
As grateful as a kiss, as simple
As fields are blest by storms of spring:
As a fit sequel to the roast:
As Lensky’s life that knew no guile,
As Eugene stares his heart is chilled
Are in them, and the sparkle of 
First: he accused himself of mocking
Are found absurd or else offensive 
Are far too pleasant to seem long.
Are crammed with all that’s necessary:
Are cordial to the country cousins.
Are certain that it only means 
Are all your relatives quite w ell?
Are all but flowing; her heart flutters,
A living picture, or a jest.
Another neighbor tapped his skull:
Another day without an aim;
Another ! . . . No, I could have given
For Eugene to behold him there 
pearing in later editions.
Another’s joy her heart possesses. 
Another’s amorous invention
Anew the garrulous fond lyre?
And, there at home, for Russia sigh.
And, seated, eagerly is eyeing
And, if my novel is to thrive.
And, feeling they had done their best,
And young in youth; blessed is he 
For all their views and passions not,
And you, my dear, are doomed to perish;
And you, bright phantoms round him thronging,
For army service; kept the books;
And yet more pleasant, on the sly
And yet her trust he’d not belie,
And yet Odessa, our wet city,
And worn in comfort, far from town.
And with my vanished spring, it seems,
And with love’s sw^eet confusion dizzy,
And why? What am I striving for?
And while a husband is respected
And where the faithful suitor hovers,
On us the favors that men crave;
And when, besides, her heart was wrung:
And when their wives talked, it was worse.
And when the little girls collected
And when consoled by art — and fame,
And when a star dropped down the sky
And w^ho could wield the poet’s pen. 
When I am gone, and cannot know it.
For lady never, no, not one.
For learning takes an utter fool.
For marriage bond or marriage bell;
For me? Shall I yet see you winging 
And urged along the outbreak’s course.
For rustic freedom thus delights,
And turns to what is hers no more:
And turned a joyful face to greet him
And truffles, luxury of youth,
And trifles of importance to
For the corvee he substituted
And to my lips the words came thronging;
And throws this challenge in our teeth:
And there she stayed, and wept, and wept.
And there he also wrote another
And the world smiled upon her, pressing
And the smooth waters, mirror-bright,
For this new hero prithee feel a
And the polite world’s hurly-burly.
For thus he brings his passion’s fuel
And the opinion of the town . . .
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
And tells her doll with anxious thought
And talk that brighten’s friendship’s ways.
And sulked, and swore that he would trim
And suddenly he’s at the gate.
And started on his aimless cruising.
Forget the feelings that held riot
And some harsh judges found, forsooth,
And solitude — this was, in fine,
Forgive me: Tanya, from the start,
And so the guests would say good-bye.
Forgotten bridges rot and sink;
Forth rushes greedy youth to capture 
And sings, off key. The song is greeted
And silhouetted by the beams,
And she — she who for Tanya posed . . . 
A merry tune that, all unwilling,
And seemed about to faint and fall;
And search my nonsense for some wit.
And scrapes his chair along the floor;
And re-upholstered for the trip.
French dishes for the gourmet’s tooth.
French prelate who was Napoleon’s chaplain; his 
And prim young misses looking sage;
And out of an old-fashioned notion
Fresh grief would cause a keener smart —
And one fibne morning finds him flying
And on their skates the merry boys
And nowhere is a spot of ink.
And now she leaps and claps her heels.
And night would find her far from sleep. 
And neighbor wheezes unto neighbor.
And my heart whispered: it is he!
And love’s delicious dream, and, too,
And looks, and calls him . . . But no power
And longing thus, be forced to meet you
And lifts his hand as who defies
And it is weighted down with snow;
And in the mist her little finger
And in our names (and in our verses);
And hotter yet the blush is glowing
And his the charm of simple art.
And here too was [Prolasov], stunted
And heedless of the winter fun.
And having stared through my lorgnette
And had no word for him but blame —
And grief changed to serenity.
And golden autumn is arriving.
From that dull hole . . And his lorgnette
And glance, unwilling, in the glass.
And girls who kiss with laughs and hugs,
And gains the brookside, breathing fast.
And friendship’s claims he was refusing.
And fled afar . . . She followed me.
And fawn and play the hypocrite.
And faster, faster throbs her heart.
And enters the deserted court.
And enters softly without rapping,
And entered. Here the throng is trooping; 
Not deep or learned or intense.
And did his shade in sorrow yearn?
And dashes off. Before the morrow
And curls as black as they were long.
And cruel traitresses who smile.
And craved the forest’s shady boon.
And chats of this and that politely;
And breathe the free air of the stage,
And boasts the freedom of the wings,
And blissful still, since all unknowing,
And bids us cast away the wreath 
Go with the solemn folk who bore you.
And at the window, not too grim.
And as she reads, the tears will rise
And ardently this Muse of mine
And answer with the barest greeting.
And also our calm hours of leisure.
And all that sparkles, triumphs, sings.
And ail would relish the report
And Russians too he would peruse:
And I am such. Was it naught better
A missive eloquent of passion.
And Grandison, who leaves us sleeping.
And . . . could not. Now she spoke, inquiring
Gray skies, and heaps of straw in billows
An uhlan wooed her, not in vain;
An honest fellow, be it noted.”
An escort much, puffed out his chest 
Among her groves and meadows ranging.
Although my freedom did not please me.
Although her book has no pretensions
Although I’ve glanced at, in times gone,
Alone among his new possessions,
Grow fond — out of sheer idleness.
Alone along the sea-shore; then
Alone a lazy boatman lifted
All wish to see their daughters wed
All this was but the bored profession
All rise; he marches to the door.
All kin and kennels, crops and wine;
A mob-cap and a dressing-gown.
All in good time, serene and thrifty —
All greedy boredom’s progeny.
Had been refurbished, yawn he must.
Yes, and the fear of the impression
All’s hushed: within the parlor, sighing
Alas! by a friend’s hand was slain.
Ail this is futile, and you know it,
A mocking demon stirs within me
Ah, yes, at some far distant date,
Had made the choice, ’twas not her own;
Ah, friends, how I rejoiced, beholding
Aghast, Tatyana recognized
Against the palm that holds it tight: 
Affairs of state, and over there 
"Zarema”: the Khan’s jealous wife, who figures in
Above this modest urn there hung 
Above the chess-board they will sit.
Has found a refuge from the blast 
About the self-same thing, this clacking 
About her older sister now.
A young girl’s ardor, clear of guile.
A wretched ghost, a foreign joke
A word to solace and to save me:
A wind -mill all alone is whirling.
A welcome; it was not surprising 
A wanton sigh was not worth mention:
A virgin of ripe years, accepts
A very pedant in the youth.
A tumult in the Russian heart!
Have paid to folly what’s her due.
Have passages on nature vying 
A thing the winter could not chain;
A thing Albani might have done;
A sweet remembrance to ensure.
My handsome house and my soirees —
A stroke of genius, nothing less.
A spider; here a red-capped skull 
Having attained to twenty -six —
A moment, and the pair once more
Having, to satisfy a whim.
He’d catch the moment of emotion.
A serf-boy takes his dog out sleighing,
A regimental band is coming!
A pure love’s innocent effusion;
A poppy could not match your face.”
A pleasant notoriety?
He’d suffered j&rom such things for years.
A place for the old-fashioned splendor: 
A pattern spread; and soon what yearning 
He’s dignified, he dyes his hair.
A note of Lensky’s composition;
A northern ball in all its glory,
He’s in, and flying to the mill.
A noisy brood. Not without fighting.
He’s read and read, and pray, what for?
A noise off in the servants’ quarters 
A night of magic, and a moon . . .
He barely spoke; his urgent mission
He bowed to her without a word.
He calls for help, in misery;
He came, unripe, unto the tomb!
He came. And her eyes opened. Quaking,
He can no longer be enchanted,
He cannot give me happiness.”
He caught the post with eager haste,
He comes upon her, as he enters.
He comes: a cork pops, up it goes.
He could forget himself completely.
He counts the slow hours, vainly trying
He curses women’s whim with force.
original the husband shouts, "fora!”, the Italian cry 
He decorates it earnestly:
He did not die or go insane.
He did not know that books could say things
He did not value letters much.
By sullen time, and soon grow wry 
He did stop short of suicide.
He died a short hour before dinner.
He dined here. What fine gentlemen!
He dined, he danced, he fenced, he rode.
He does not cease his stubborn stare:
He does not even guess my pain.
He does not heed the mind’s reproaches,
He drinks: with greedy howls they swill;
He dropped his eyes in irritation
He early knew the agitation
He early played the fond deceiver.
He erred; for Eugene, hardy sinner.
He feared that he had not incited
He feels that it must break with grieving. 
He fell from off a Kalmuck stallion.
He finds that no remarks occur
He first abandoned you, capricious
He fled their noisy conversation
He found it puzzling but alluring;
He found the fairest faces null;
He found the matter not too clear.
He frowns, and everyone is still;
He gazes, and his heart is riven:
He gives his man the arms to carry
He goes in to the princess, quaking;
He had no itch to dig for glories
He had some other expectation?
He has a single thought to ponder:
He has it still — a touching note,
He held that loyal friends and steady
He held that some by Fate were chosen
He holds a stocking he was mending;
He hoped that in good time I’d marry
He hows to sundry friends; his mocking
He is the victim of remorse.
He is, though not renowned or quoted,
He joins the throng on the boulevard^
He killed eight years thus like a dunce —
He knew one constant inspiration.
He knew one torment, one delight
He knew the ruses that would brighten
He knew the task would sorely try him
He knows dehght when he’s adjusting
He laughs, and they are all guffawing;
He lay most strangely there at rest.
He lays her down upon the sill.
He leads her, nonchalantly gliding.
He leaves the ladies’ hands unkissed;
He left his rustics to their tillage,
He let the classic laurel fade,
He let the summer season fly,
He listened to young Lensky, smiling:
He lived — in summer rose at seven;
A lively horse, but not too restive,
He looked the poet, when he’d let a
Do not spy upon our games.
He looked them over, boxed them right,
He loved as people love no longer
He loved me, and the dawn of life
He loved the dark and shunned the daytime,
He loves you ... as a relative!
He marked the time, and presently
He marks the hour with some dismay:
He may pick up her handkerchief.
He might have altered and deserted
He might have gone to bed and died
He might have learned that life was shabby
He must be off without delay.
He never thought of the vexation 
He noted with accustomed malice.
He now repents him of the course
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
He offered solace and delight,
He offers all a grand example;
He often paid a call, surmising 
He paid the Muses honor due;
He passes over in a rush
He pens, with trembling hand and weak,
He pours out fluent melodies;
He quits his place of hibernation —
He quits the rout, and, meditating.
He racked his brains, and still believed
"You love the younger? Curious creature!”
He read miscellany and journal.
He rescued them, and with the knack
He said, and found his words the cue
He sang life’s bloom and early blight:
He sang of parting and repining;
He sang the rose, romantic flower;
He savors the few words that settle
"Why do you say so?” "Not a feature 
He seems to see his Olga there
He seems, indeed, an alien here,
He sees forgotten foes, malicious 
He sees the self-willed Terek flinging
He set his mind to work with zest.
He set the ladies’ eyes aglow.
He sighed, no longer subject to them:
He sighs: ^'They’re past the age — it’s shocking! 
He soon consigns them to perdition. 
He spared the rod to spoil the boy,
He spared us, true, one piece of folly;
He swam this Hellespont anew,
He talked about the wealth of nations;
He thought it no great loss — perchance
He thought the tomes his daughter kept
He thought: I must not disconcert him
He thrust his nose in right away.
He took his coffee here, and rested,
He took, and fain would be forgiven;
He trembles, cannot say a word,
He turned a partial eye on it.
He waits with jealous indignation
He waits: and up a troika prances,
He wakes to find a note — that’s pleasant:
He walks into the empty lobby.
He wanted to converse with her
He was a veteran in love.
He was convinced the fickle fair
He was in bliss. Indeed, thrice blessed 
He was no fool; and Eugene, ready
He was none of your poetasters,
He was not one to pick and choose.
He watched her as she played and sang;
He waved his hand, as one who’d rue it
He well knew how to set you laughing.
He who could never understand
He will lie late, and on Ms tray 
He wore a dressing-gown himself;
He would implore the shy confession.
He would not play the base deceiver.
He writes a verse for her to dote on —
He yawns and starts to snore again.
He yawns, for serious labor tries him.
Headlong into a world unknown.
"When did he get here, by the bye?
Held Richardson as dear as life.
Heloise; Clarissa: the heroine of Clarissa Harlotve; 
Her anguished heart some peace w as granteti
Her billowy soft rugs are flung;
Her cheek rests on her hand, and she
Her chest heaves, and her cheeks are kindled 
Her countrified simplicity 
Her darkening eyes she never raises;
Her dear familiar room shows plain,
Her dove, her confidante devoted,
Her dowdy frocks, and to their mercies 
Her dreams in every circumstance 
Her dreamy mood did not consort
Her eyes betray her with a tear.
Her eyes shine, and her breath has dwindled.
Her face would pale, her body quivered.
Her father saw no harm in reading
Her flaxen hair, her graceful poses.
Her flowers, her romantic novels,
Her fondness for them never changing.
Her gauzy veil aside to see 
Her grief into the garden taking,
Her growing doubts they cannot still.
Her heart assailed, where’er she went 
Her heart was filled with one alone.
Her heart, and when she likes, 'withdraws, 
Her husband, in the corner, dozing,
Her in the princess readily!
Her languor will not let her move.
Her look, so candid and serene.
Her looks, her words — he does not flatter.
Her love in Russian has confided;
Her lowered eyes agleam the while,
Her manner was what it had been
Her melancholy eyes adore him —
Her mind with agitation seething,
Her motion, in pure splendor dressed!
Her nightgown slips from off her shoulder,
Her passion, not by chance or skill; 
Her pet, Rossini, must be heard.
Her prudent husband, to distract her.
Her rosy cheeks are not less bright
Her sad fatigue, her helpless languor.
Surprise, asks: ''Where’s your second, pray?”
Her sister tempts the Muse, not she.
Her sky-blue eyes, her cheeks like roses,
Her small wet slipper’s next to go.
Her son! to distant regions fled,
Her soul was waiting . . . ah, for whom?
Not pain, but death. Thus, sparkling whitely
on the Black Sea, when the author was in quasi-exile.
Her tender fingers sewed no seam,
Her tender voice is like a reed’s.
Her terror held a secret charm:
Her trailing skirt, with hand that quivers;
Her trinkets rudely from her tearing;
Her virgin calm is of the past;
Her voice, were such as they portray
Her voiceless grief was past disguising;
Her walks are longer, she will dally
Her weakness, and she coughed and cried.
Her well-bound quarto to inscribe,
Her work the crackling matchwood lights,
Her worth, each year more sullen growing. 
Here’s Petushkov, a rural beau;
Here’s Pradt and Scott. You do not think
Here’s bronze and china in profusion.
Here’s every dainty that you please:
Here’s the exordium. That’s that!
Here’s what you find there (am I right?) :
Here’s winter! . . . The triumphant peasant
Here Lunin spoke impressively,
Here Pushkin read his verse with swagger.
Here an ambassador was weighing 
Here at my feet. But dare you say 
Here comes Gvozdin, a first-rate farmer
Here dandies now in the ascendant
Here fashionables would repair.
Here in the world’s benumbing rapture, 
Here in this village unfrequented.
Here is a ball, and there a party;
Here is a door — ^he flings it wide,
Here not a wit was found to shine
Here one heard naught but echoes, dying,
Here the patricians congregated.
Here too the plainsman comes and brags,
Here was Onegin, then, possessing
Here was a man who had a weakness
Here you will find as decoration
Here, bonneted and wearing roses,
Here, mornings, he would read his book . . . 
Hers is a calm simplicity.
Herself to love and all its laws.

Hi Too ill for hopes of getting better,

His door he locks, his lamp he trims.
His doubts were never past the curing,
His doubts: for meet they surely will

His early years were all a waste.
His enemies were always base.
His epitaph is plain as he;

His father listened, frowned, and groaned.
His friend [Kaverin] must be waiting.
His friend for thus misleading him;
His friend unburdened himself of —
His gentle touch nowise dismays her.
His hair cut in the latest mode;
His hand upon his breast lays lightly.
His head above her fondly bent,
His heart is all but crushed with pain,
His heart is by such anguish bitten
His heart leaps up, his soul is stirred.

His heart was pure, his conscience clear;
His heart with sore repentance filled.

Of prejudice’s ancient yoke,

His mood no gloomier, no gayer;
His mother stands and threatens him.
His music therewith sweetly c h im i ng;
His nag has ribs that might be counted. 
His neighbor, calling out his name,
His news sets girlish hearts to drumming:
His nineteenth year was scarce in sight.
His oars above the drowsy stream;
His object was emancipation.
His page is empty as can be.
His passing came as a disaster
His pocket burns: it holds a treasure,
His precious Olga: such is love!
His principal accomplishment;
His roans bring Lensky to the door;
His sentiments were fine and true.
His sharp intelligence and chilly,
His slightest move is overawing;
His son was married recently.
His son, Lieutenant General I. A. Annibal, was

I court the Muse with indolence.
I did not ache with such desire
I drag myself about; timers hasting.
I fain would write a diatribe —

I frighten the wild ducks by rolling

I hate red lips that are unsmiling,

I have no care for flighty fame;
I have no faith in its requiting
I have no tears, in spite of grief;
I have seen other belles who bent
I have them here for you to see:
I hear the magic of your voice,
I heard her friendly accents soften;
I know that life is but a bubble,
I know there’ll be a warm reception
I know your heart; I need not tremble.
I left you in a dreadful fright;
I like a life of country quiet;
I liked, and his peculiar pose;
I listened, not without elation.
I looked for peace in prayer, kneeling.
I lose the thread, my mind’s not clear.
I love fierce youth, my private passion
I love you (why should I dissemble?)
I loved your image even then;
I loved, and nothing could relieve me. 
I married. Now, I beg you, go.
I marveled at their iron virtue,
I might (who knows?) have grown contented.
I might indeed make bold to borrow
I moved there also for a while,

I shall lose patience soon, of course:
I shall not suffer the deceiver
I shall recall the tongue of longing.

I take my leave of you — farewell.

Inspired by tender melancholy,

Into a more exacting book.
Into one image, her heart leaping 
Into the flooded meadowlands.

Into the silent study, setting

Of plates and silverware increases,

Lions on gates with great stone jaws,
Liqueurs, a ledger, applejack,
Lives there a poet who rehearses
Living the chapters through, she’d glory
Lo! the opinion of the rabble
Long evening pass, while he would sit 
"But tell me who she is.” "My wife.”
Long live Bordeaux, the faithful friend!
Long since her dreams had set her yearning
Long since with sweet disquietude
Long since, but notice if you please 
Long years, maybe, a sudden spark . . .
Look back she dare not; fear would blind her;
Looking too corpselike to be nobby.
Looks backward; lightning-like she rushes 
Looks round: the bear is gone, at least; 
Lord Byron’s tales, which well consorted
Lord help us, friends! To be accursed
Lorgnette in hand, our friend would wander,
Lost like a muted sound and vanished.
Love’s discourse, perilous, delicious,
Love your own self and so have done!
Loves elbow-room and thrusts us hence?
Low cunning must assist devotion
Lubov Petrovna lies as quickly,
Lukerya Lvovna still paints thickly,
"But it’s a bore, my firiend, that’s clear.”
MOSCOW, Russia’s darling daughter,
"Ah, then you know him?” "Yes, and no.”
Made game of fools, and being bent 
Maidens, come and trip it now,
Makes Eugene quake with consternation.
Malek-Adhel and de Linar,
Malvine — because the set was broken 
Mammas and aunts who pry and peer.
Many a distant love-affair —
Mashuk, most health-giving of mountains;
May Heaven blast your page, amen!
May his soul now be with the blest.
Tatyana fills his every thought;
May pay attention to his nails;
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
May wear the laurel -crown of fame,
Mayhap he would have been reputed.
Mayhap the lyre so early muted
Me if you must: I can’t translate.
Means labor fit to break the back . . .
Meanwhile, forget all toil and trouble,
Meanwhile, in morning costume, gaily
Meanwhile, the moon her silver duty
"Ah, nurse, nurse darling, I am hounded 
of the carriage, was knocking against the mile-posts 
Might dash away as they were nearing.
Might have united them anew!
Mile-posts rejoice the idle eye,
Monsieur FAbbe, a Frenchman, seedy,
Monsieur Finemouche, friend of the house, 
Monsieur was sent upon his way.
More horrors: here a lobster riding
More lingeringly half the world.
More often now the sun was clouded;
More than a brother’s love for you.
Moscow: those syllables can start
Most blessed is he who never knew them.
Most fearful and most wonderful!
Most harshly: there was no disguising
Move plates and chairs with ready glee,
Much to enchant his virgin mind.
Must breathe no word, must never mention
Must in this matter be your guide.
Must leave my hero, ruefully,
Mute anger only marks her face . . .
Mute, motionless, and cherub -faced;
My Eugene through the winter tarried.
My Eugene was [Chadayev] second:
My Grandison? Oh, Grandison!
My Lensky’s fury grows apace;
My Moscow offered Bonaparte —
My Muse to a superb soiree;
My brainless pupil almost learned
My childish dreams, my tender years,
My conscience speaks — ^pray let me finish;
My country, and an exile’s lot —
"Ah, but the elegy is flighty.
My days are counted: Fve had warning;
My dear, is an important matter:
My dear, when old age comes at length
My earnest counsels prithee heed.
My fair Russian Terpsichore?
My flighty friend made quite a stir.
My fondness for it is but slight;
My friends. Perhaps, by heaven’s decree,
My frivolous and merry youth!
My girlish dreams forever stilled.
A sudden gust of wind surprises
My heart to one, and one alone!
My story out, and it is wrong 
My heart will as of old be shaken.
My high-flown fancies have departed.
My husband’s folk . . . But do you hear?”
My labors — bless them with thy beauty^
My labors, yet perhaps this name 
My stanza, saved by jealous fate,
"Agreed.” "Now that is good of you!”
My lips were envious of their blisses!
"A story?” asked the good old woman,
My little nook do not forsake;
My lively cousin now advancing.
My love, first warm, would soon diminish, 
My meaning? Nothing. Aly intention
My mother coaxed and wept; the sequel
My mother-in-law would have raged.”
My mournful secret you will shun me:
My name . . .” ^'^Yes, but to whom, my dear?
My poet friends, inclined to stammer
My poor nurse sleeps beneath the bough . . .
My restless thoughts, and I must perish. 
My services in time of need:
My soul’s fair crystal, what surpasses
My soul with dreams that challenge reason. 
I bow and cede my rights to you . . .
My stricken heart cries out and fails me
My legs betray me . . . But it’s tiring
My student cell grew bright with treasures
My style and my affairs improving.
My thanks for all the hours of gladness,
My thanks, friend, you will not refuse.
My thanks. Alike in peace and riot 
My thoughts in exile turned to you,
My tuneful stanzas forth till they 
My words may move some unborn lover;
xlv As bored as I with vain inventions —
My youth fled by, remembrance clings.
My youth in slothful sweet content?
Myself mistaken, did not dare 
N'est-ce pas, for all we want of talk? 
xlv One thought I would that you were keeping

Near by, she saw the mansion standing.

Neva, oh, offspring of my pen.
Never shall I my soul renew . . .
New leaves for those the tempests scatter. 
New sorrows come, my heart to fret;
New warmth has melted winter’s chain; 
Next day before the sun was high.
Night falls; the moon, already riding
Nikita, restless, keen for glory,
No bard was keen as I to follow
No breath disturbs the warm still night.
No card-game, poetry, or ball.
No coarse mot of a witty snob.
No fancy of a worldly mob.
No feast, no gift to warm his heart:
No finer, but just finicky.
No gift but weariness and anguish 
No grace, no flash of merriment.
No longer fearful of disaster.
xlv This is what poets should be drinking
No matter— ah, but look with favor
No matter. Why should we be asking
No matter: lisping like a child,
No more I find it quite so pressing
No more a reason for emotion,
No more can hoyden rhymes detain me,
No more my Eugene could discern . . .
No more the casual pen is led 
No more the vogue, you will allow.
No other entertainment needing.
No partner ever was so sprightly.
No punishment is equal to it.
No respite to his heart is granted —
No rival in the girl’s affection . , .
Unknown to butterfly and bee.
No savoir vivre^ no hint of verse;

No single sound escapes from her;
No smart conceits does Lensky fashion
No sooner did the cannon, sounding
No sound, save for the soft slow roar
No syllable of sentiment.

No, passion never wrought for me
No, silent, wild, and melancholy,
No, soon the world began to bore him.
No, to he with you constantly;
No, when with youth and love on fire,
Noise, chatter, on the table shine
None was so quick as he at trapping
Nor bends to fashion’s tyrannies:
Then, with a look that showed her tiring,
Nor cards, nor gossip, chased his gloom; 
Nor distance, changed his earnest mood
Nor eases tears too long suppressed.
Nor from his greedy lips withdraws 
Nor full of idle chat and silly;
Nor noisy games, nor foreign beauties.
Nor read the ending of the story.
Nor reckoned days as they went by,
Nor shown a fighter’s predilection.
Nor soothes the ache within her breast.
Nor studies such as pedants choose,
Nor was she found with head inclining
Nor yet the cuckold, stout and haughty.
Nor yet were her soft lips compressed.
Nor, from the loge and the parterre,
Not aiming yet, advance four paces.
Not all Onegin’s observation
Not far from Bonaparte’s tent.
And drop in stars upon the shore.

Not hesitating to awake him.
Not hours when he fulfilled the duties
Not knowing in the morning where

Not long the Larin house was waking
Not now. I love my hero truly.
Not now: we, like the ladies, proudly
Not only did she fail to shiver.
Not so his calculating neighbor
Her spouse had not a word to say.
Not thus have sought to cut a dash.
Not what you have, but what you see 
Not with a notion of delighting 
Notes here. Those not marked ^'Pushkin” have been added
Nothing attracted his attention.
Now I am at your mercy, guided
Now Lovelace’s renown is faded.
Now Olga sits before it, filling
Now Yule-tide brings its fun and folly.
Now cut the ice with scraping noise;
Now different scenes delight my senses:
Now five steps more the pair have made.
Now from the dish where they are lying
Now from the shed at crack of dawn
Now having given due attention
Now in his study he bethought him
Now met his spouse. The princess gazed 
Now my Onegin, keen as brandy.
Now my companions are inquiring:
Now nearer! Galloping . . . and here 
Now on what flowers are they set?
Now serpentine she twists and wheels,
Now sleeps the scion of delight.
Now soothed by this anticipation.
Now southward swept the caravan
Now stirred? Is it vexation moving 
Now the mazurka’s strains are sounding.
Now through the open meadow faring,
Now with what eager concentration
Now" let me speak of something jolly.
O’er Petersburg’s dark pavements borne 
O’er her embroidery, designing 
O’ergrown. No wreath hangs on the bough; 
xlvi But lulled by the fond dream that dowers
xlvi I love it still, at the dictation
xlvi One who has felt, is often mournful.
Obeying folly’s least suggestion,
Obeying the spring sun’s commands,
Obeys her feelings sans demur?
Oblige me! Is it such hard labor?”
Oblivion is waiting for us
Observe his closet well, and gage
Observe it with a yawn at last,
Observed the girl’s embarrassed air.
Obtaining, with himself to thank.
Odessa was my home then, shrouded
Of Cleopatra, but whose features.
Of Kamenka’s deep groves and hilly 
Of Lensky’s troth there was no chatter:
Of Lovelace or of Grandison,
xlvi The homage that the gay world tenders,
Of Olga’s looks alive to me.
Of Sundays, putting on his glasses,
Of a most tyrannous young fop.
Of all sorts; finally you hear 
Of all the dreams the heart can hold.
Of any nonsense I set down,
Of comme il faut — Shishkov, berate 
Of corks, with much the same attention 
Of course you’ve often seen that treasure.
Of course young Lensky felt no yearning
Of course, one should reward his gabble
Of curses: he’s gone home to change.
Of days long past, when he had been
Of destiny and its defiance.
Of distance, promising delight;
Of elegies at some far date 
Of fables, and a grammar too.
Of feasts and sundry foods and eke 
Of finding worn-out prejudices.
Of fools, and slyly whispered quips ...”
Of good and evil, and of science,
Of heels the stout parquet would quake,
Of heirs is heard, indecently 
Of her companions in the blue.
Of her demure provincial ways,
Of her own heart’s shy hopes and fears;
Of her researches quite forgets
Of high desires and deep regret,
Of him had filled his simple youth,
Of idle youth that no one blames,
Its wings with crazy motions twirling;
Of innocent felicity.
Of intimacies of the past.
Of jdowers, for our modest dwelling.
Of jealous pangs, and separation,
Of letters running to six pages.
Of life’s gay feast ere time is up,
Of life has perished like a flower 
Of loud farewells and crying maids;
Of lovely lady, modish sir.
Of loves that to the grave endure;
xlvii A thread of smoke is upward drifting;
Of memory, or welcome rest,
Of my young friend I sing, and of
Of old the ballroom used to shake 
Of park and palace, dome and spire,
His mare scents snow upon the pleasant
At Whitsun, when the populace
Alw"ays together, now they’re sitting
Of seeing you by afternoon . . . .
Into the woods, pursued, she presses;
Of seething hopes and giddy play,
Of silence he had lain at rest
Of snow, and wash her face and chest.
Of some attractive little thing.
Of some imported wild romance. 
Of speech to this insulting passion.
Of speech, and earn the mockery 
Of speech? For what malicious laughter 
Of such a manner, I’m pedantic.
Of syllables so musical 
Of that dread mystery, the grave;
Of that lost hour beneath the tree 
Of the Black Sea upon the shore.
xlvii Embellished with a little slander,
Of this and that, to his distress;
Enough, sing other tunes, move on!” 
Of this cold world, his soul would bless 
Of those he wished her to forget!
Of tulle she wore in other days;
Of welcome are indeed heart-rending.
Of what is common, what is grand;
Of what, in fashionable diction
Of which I’ve lost the habit now.
Of which Onegin never tired.
Of whom ’twas said throughout his span:
Of wintry pleasures; you will dote 
Of worldly scorn, and thus are fed.
Of youth renewed beside these streams.

Oh, yes. But there’s the whirl of fashion.
Old W’omen, boys with cheeks like cherries,
Old duelist can be malicious:
Old fogies all, chained to tradition,
Old monkeys of another age 
Old women smiled as she went by;
Old-fashioned hospitality.

On balls I also used to dote:

On whom shall we bestow affection,
His appetite for pleasure’s hearty —
On writing of another man.
On your protection till I die . . .

Once graced the devil’s own abode,

She clambered up a hill, commanding
She conned the talk against her will;
She could but peak and pine and weep,
She cries: ^'Whom, Tanya, did you see?”
She dare not lift, for shame and fear.
She did not speak the language well
She did the overseeing; cool
She does not argue: by delaying
She does not breathe, she does not stir;
She does not heed: and sore it grieves him
She does not raise him, leaves him kneeling;
She does not sniff the cold, or run
She dreams. And wonders are appearing
She drops her handkerchief, and shivers,

She falls into the snow; alertly
She fancied ghosts behind her stalking.
She fears the dream bodes only ill.

She flies, a thing of down, enchanted;
She flies, she flies, nor in her flight 
She followed, as he did, the fashion;
She found in a romantic story
She found the margins most appealing:
To the low grave, to sit and weep.
She glances at the road, distressed.
She glides; and now serenely stops,
She had not read with fascination
She halted at the gate-way, telling
She halted, like one scorched by fire. 
She has no aim, no occupation.
She has no trace of coquetry —
She hates their having come at all.
She hears and does not hear the closing
She hears it all at every visit.
She hears the raucous laughter swell 
She hurries, but the dreadful shape
She is alone, alack-a-day!
She is not hurried, is not chilly,
”She’s mine!” cries Eugene, stern and daring;
She lacked her sister’s charm, and wanted
Points out my portrait unctuously.
She lacks the look of snobbishness,
She lies as though she has not heard,
She lies for hours, with sleep uncertain;
She likes the talk of haughty sages
She looks about in puzzled sort.
She looks about, with heart that flutters:
She looks at him in some dismay.
She looks on nothing with delight.
She looks, half soothed and half excited,
She lost her Frenchy airs and graces;
She loves an uhlan with devotion . . .
She loves him still; and in remorse,
She loves the secrets that environ 
She might return; yes, if permitted. 
She must accept at last, I thought.
She noted, trembling and excited.
She pickled mushrooms with her cooks;
She pinched her waist with tightened laces,
She puzzles till she is distracted,
She quaked at omens; all around her
She reads the sweet romance, and how
She rises as the morning flushes
She runs, he follows on and on;
”Of maids and creatures superhuman?
She searches for a passage showing
She seemed a stranger to her own.
She seems the image quite perfected
She sees . . . Why, who would credit it? 
She sees a court she does not know,
She shared our banquets, crowned our joys —
She should go home, where guests are waiting
She shuddered, mute; her lovely eyes
She sighs, she pines both day and night!
She sits with an untroubled air.
She sits with downcast head, too lax
When his hot fingers touch her hand.
She speaks to them as to old friends.
She stands, suffused with shy emotion.
She stifles here . . . her heart is sore.
She suffocates; she scarcely hears
She then, as love has power to do,
She thinks, uncertain, and goes on.
She thumbed her Martin till he knew
She too at length came forth, and nigh 
She trembles like a hunted fawn;
She waits: when will the answer come? 
She walks ahead. The old crone mutters:
She wanders with imagined lovers
She was affianced, but her mother
She was no beauty: that were fiction
She was not one of those who glories
She went. Onegin stood forsaken,
refuge from the fires that were ravaging the city.
She will not find her meadows there.
She will not see him, the betrayer;
She would go stumbling down the road.
She would not win you by her face,
Shed rainbow lights across the snow
Shines the resplendent southern sun —
Shorter and shorter grew the days;
Should I not give the letter’s text 
Should cross her path while she was walking, 
Should giddy deity desire
”No, nobody! You’re quite secure,
To the kind invalid, and yet 
Shouts bravo in his sleep, and then
Show off their impudence, their vests.,
Show rapture or indifference,
Showed him so cold and calm a brow?
Shows passion’s volatility?
Shy as the doe who runs alone.
Simplicity to her young dream?
Since Latin’s held not worth attention,
Since but a random education
Since infancy her only pleasure
Since the dead days of Romulus.
Since time, without my interference,
Since you were christened? Gracious sakes!
Sing a song, a happy song.
Sing and bring a dashing lad
Singer of feasts and tender sorrow,
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Sits down; the game is done — ^he goes;
Sits home, awaiting the reply;
Slapped servant-girls who were unpleasant;
Sleepless, Tatyana would converse 
Slight errors have a choice effect.
Slow eyes come last to rest upon 
Smooth aria, the eager plea.
So Eugene preached and Tanya listened,
So Heaven wills it. Your young soul 
So Tanya bit by bit is learning
So be it! Now my destiny
So be it; but I had to speak;
So countrified, a bit dejected,
So different, first they bored each other.
So easily, with passion seethed;
So elegantly can devise 
So exquisite as sacrifice;
So fortune-telling’s not for us.
So he returned, took Chatzky’s cue.
So pious are they, so precise.
So things went on beside the chilly
So to their destination straightway
So turning morning into night,
Soft glance, nor welcome sweetly caroled.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Some charming spot to hold her still.
Some clue the index may afford her. 
Some dunce may yet pronounce as he 
Some fragment of his Northern art.
Some pages held a sharp incentive
Some, honor’s victims, scarred by war,
Some, prey to piles, or Aphrodite;
Something more certain to amuse.
Sometimes he reads to Olga, trying
Soon brought us, if you please, to Paris,
Soon found a way to soothe her pain;
Soon the dry valleys will be blooming;
Soon, soon my soul will not remember: 
Sounding the cry that all was well;
Spoke of divorce in her despair.
Spring calls you to the verdant soil.

Stares out upon the shadowed lea:
Stay indoors, by a book befriended?
Steel files and combs of various guises,
Steep cliffs above the ocean’s purl,
Stifled, in solitude, unknown.
Still clings to hope, though it be slender.
Still half asleep, nature is meeting
Stood like a threatening apparition;
Stood thunderstruck. He could not stir.
Storm-giver Zeus decrees Odessa
Straight past the porter, like an arrow
Straight to the stranger Tanya speeds,
Strange Jean Sbogar enchants her too.
Strange faces mid the painted set.
Strange woes that left me broken-hearted . . .
Stuff that the Flemish school would draw.
Submissive through the grave’s dark portal. 
Such are the bard’s gratifications;
Such as the Muse alone can bring;
Such bliss is transient, if absurd;
Such faithful friendship as my hero’s
Such feelings in this troubled heart,
Such is the guerdon of your daring!
Such is the news he’s eager for.
Such people with each day grow duller.
Such shoulders I have never known!
Such stuff as Lafontaine has written . . .
Such treachery who could forget?
Such vulgar scenes as these despising.
Suppose your pistol-shot has ended
Been married long?” ^’Two years.” whom?”
Surrendered his inheritance;
Deep truths, or well-drawn scenes — yet not
Surveying fallow land and plowed.
Suspicious age could do no less,
Sweet Lei now hovers o’er her head.
”But for a season it will do;
”And this is my Tatyana.” 'Taney!
”Ah, nurse, your mind is not in question.
TO ONEGIN But you^re unsociable, they say.
TO ONEGIN Dispel my doubts! My mind^s awhirl;
”Ah, nurse, I know you won’t refuse me.”
”1?” ”Yes, a birthday celebration —
Take off, and smoothly soar away.
Take rest, young poet, as thy wage.”
Take what is offered of delight.
Talon’s Ms goal, no hesitating:
Tanya’s the center of attraction.
Tanya prepared for fortune- telling
Tanya surveys it with a start.
Tanya with simple faith defended
Tanya, her silken belt untying,
Tanya, my dear, your looks distress me.”
Tanya, though she could give no reason,
With noisy haste the throng decamps;
”0h, there will be a dreadful babble,
Tatyana’s bloom is all but faded;
Tatyana’s brilliant catch discerning,
Tatyana’s husband is appearing.
Tatyana’s letter For days^ until another meeting.
Tatyana’s letter Or but a tempter to undo me?
Tatyana’s letter lies before me,
Tatyana’s match was ail the rumor;
Tatyana’s solitude adds fuel
Tatyana’s trouble; but each eye 
Tatyana burned and shivered, asking:
Tatyana cannot but be grateful
Tatyana cannot stop her tears.
Tatyana does, expecting that the mirror will reflect 
Tatyana goes, impelled by love.
May pass me by or pierce me through;
Tatyana had no doll at all
Tatyana hears the chorus sounding,
Tatyana in the court appears,
Tatyana is alone; but making 
Tatyana leaps like nothing mortal 
Tatyana like a child surrenders 
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana looked as though she heard 
Tatyana might be found romancing
Tatyana moans, and as she shivers
Tatyana read no Russian journal.
Tatyana scanned them without fail.
Tatyana sets the door ajar . . .
Tatyana should be settled, too.
Tatyana shows no sign of caring
Tatyana stares in fascination,
Tatyana thrills with pain and pleasure
Tatyana took her silent way
Tatyana trembled and grew red. 
Tatyana was her name then — granted.
Tatyana was her sister’s name:
Tatyana watched them drive away 
Tatyana, and with failing breath.
Tatyana, breathless, caimot stir;
Tatyana, dear Tatyana! Weeping,
Tatyana, dreaming, walked alone.
Tatyana, spell-bound, lingers still.
Tatyana, still an early riser,
[i-vij A woman’s love for us increases
Tatyana, the society lady, is unexplained and too 
Tatyana, who spoke each one fair;
Ally or enemy, attend
Than anything that I could do —
Not for you our songs are sung.
Than face them; he who has gone through it
Than halt bewildered on the shore.
Than in the north Aurora’s blushes.
Than is the moon one sees at dawn;
Than other men are doomed to feel:
Than that you sought, poor innocent. 
Than this: a household where the wife 
Than with a quite impartial pen 
That’s fine, but if the truth were told.
That’s where the eligibles are!”
That Hymen brings, the grief and pain, 
That I am feeling far from strong; 
That I am not Onegin’s sort;
That I had stained my reputation — 
” You ’ll have to take her to the city —
That I should see you once a week 
That Ovid sang, that brought him here, 
That ancient glory still shines bright . ,
That ardent and most charming letter?
That argues a resourceful poet,
That at Very’s on credit he 
That bodes full flowers and honeyed fruit. 
That burdened my Tatyana’s heart! 
That by a sudden storm was drenched;
That could not very well be worse.
That day would soon be on the march.
That does not frighten anyone
That even thirteen-year-old misses
That fine parquet can never muster.
That forms the ducklings’ paradise.
That have come down the years to us 
That he must have a change of scene
That he, when wheels were within hearing,
of Pushkin’s, translated French tragedies, while Shak- 
That huckleberry syrup will,
That ladies’ feet have had for me.
That little girl ... is it a dream?
That little girl he did not deem
That man alone knows blessedness 
That miracles could be achieved.
That morning, gay and debonair.
That my performance is infernal,
That natiure’s season of renewal 
That no hope of renewal cheers?
That one be potted anyhow,
That only mediocrity 
That only once in a great while.
That our bright pristine hopes grew battered,
That poetry is their affair.
That poets feel, he lacked, nor knew 
’^There peasants, rich beyond all measure.
That poor Tatyana was upset.
That riots through the mountain passes;
That scarce had heard of his existence, 
That she’s ideal — he must jot 
That she should offer a narration 
That shows a statuette of iron:
That silently you spoke to me.
That silly moon you see there looming.”
That teeth and nails may both be served.
That the first strophes should be read 
That thrilled him in the days gone by,
That time and change may not erase.
That to such matters Homer pays.
That trembles with another’s passion; 
That waters well the nearby valley.
That we are driving in the dark.
That will not be ten times repeated
That write he must, and in this fashion — 
That year was extraordinary.
That you should scorn me, or ignore.
That youth was given us in vain,
The Academic lexicon.
The British Muse’s wild invention
’^Has he forgotten us — what is it?
The English spleen it may resemble,
The Hindu — diamonds in his coffer;
The Horse Guard’s spurs clank as he dances;
The Kalmucks’ flocks, contented, graze. 
The Moscow belies are many, too.
The Muse — to marriage been converted.
The Muse first shone before my eyes.
The Muse has come, and love departed,
The Nereids’ low murmuring.
The Russian envoy rescued him and sent hi m as a 
The State for long; the course of things 
The Vampire wrecks her sleep at night;
The afternoon of life is starting,
The aged, at the grave’s grim portal.
The album and the corset vanished,
The album of a country miss,
The arms are crossed — a well-known pose —
The aunts, of one thing only thinking.
The autumn seemed so loth to go;
The baker’s German and precise.
The baker’s wicket opens out,
The balcony where such a press is,
The ball’s wild gaiety was wearing.
The ball had pierced clean through the breast.
The ball-room summons one and all.
The ballroom’s ruler, scarcely human.
The bank; one hears a gentle spring;
The bear is marching at her heels.
The bear says: '^Here my gossip dwells.
The bearded old postilion’s mounted —
The beau monde*s burdensome conventions
The bed-curtains; awake completely,
The bee deserts her waxen cell
The beefsteak and the Strasbourg patty 
The bench where the old nurse was seated 
The billows covered them with kisses,
The billows, while the shrouds are rattling, 
The blithest dawn in sullen clouds.
The blood that burns tmth frantic fire;
The blow of a malignant fate.
The boa on her shoulders, and 
The bold hihitka swiftly traces
The bony hands, the sly grimaces;
The boredom: nabbing the unwary
The box, where, regnant in her splendor.
The breath of life would then infuse.
The bud that just begins to blow.
The cab, to spare the feeble nag.
In our poetic reverie
The call of fame, for you forgot 
The call to early labors dinning;
The carriage horses, chilled with waiting.
The cattle low; the nightingale
The chairs shoved backward scrape the flooring;
The chance to read his modest songs 
The charming and ingenuous maid
The charming lad was rather wild.
The cheerful morning sounds awaken;
The child of shrewdness and of daring,
The child while still at play prepares
’^"There Mithridates sought his end”: when Push-
The city breathes of Europe; hotly.
And with a cheerful eye to greet you ! —
The city soon will wear resounding
The classic trumpet, sword, and mask; 
The clouds before him — can it be?
The coachmen round the bonfires tramp.
The cold pretensions to success.
’Twould give you in society 
The columns of the city gate
The company commander, whom 
The company could see no harm
The comrade upon whom she doted.
The contemplative dryads played.
The cordial words: 'There was a poet!” 
The cost of post-horses, was glad 
The coughs, the shouts and hisses sounding.
The country life, the rustic hovels.
The country round about was still,
The country to the past is tender.
The country, and its dulness, bore you;
The couple stood, to say good-bye.
The couples as they whirl aw*ay,
The couples to the table swarm;
The courtyard white, a white parterre,
The creature bellows in reply 
The creatures fancy animated;
The creditors began to gather,
The crooked trunks, the gleaming claw^s.
The crowd of house-sprites, blowing out 
The crowd whose sparkle nothing dims,
The crowd, the hubbub, and the glitter!
The cruel fates have surely not 
The crunch of snow . , « a step approaches;
The curtain rustles as it soars;
The customs that our elders knew.
The czar caroused with zest, but mark!
The dale is dark and vapor-ridden.
The darkened mind is clear again; 
The darling object was provided
The dawn shines ruddy; Olga rushes 
The day is done: he’s not replying,
The day my father gave his blessing;
The day of busy cares is blessed.
The day to come, what is it bearing?
The day upon which they intended
The day was set, his heart elated;
The days speed by; before you know it
The dazzling capital, forgot —
The dead man buried, they were able
The dedication is addressed to Pyotr Alexandro-
The dining-room: on chairs they slumber. 
The dogs attack her, all but biting
The dolts that must be tolerated.
The door swings wide, and Lensky’s here,
The double windows, the snug fire;
The dread of vice, the fear of shame.
The dreaded one, the dearly prized:
The dream alarms her, and not knowing
The dream pervades her mournful moods.
The driver on his box we note
The drum is heard, the city’s rousing,
The editor has followed closely the text of the first
The end of the mazurka, and 
The enemies their mantles doff.
The errors are a trifle merely.
The exile from society
The eyeglass of the connoisseur.
The eyes of the ingenuous young;
The faces one meets everywhere;
The fair ones, whom you were addressing 
The fair young pilgrim must go home.
The faithful one is soon affected:
The family is well; they send you
The family would meet and talk,
The fashion of a bygone day:
The fatal hour is past recall;
The father’s simple words repeating.
The fathers, indeed all, could see
The fear, the shame, are past endurance . . .
The fearful bill, unheeded, mounts.
The feast goes on, but soon thereafter
The feast he was quite unprepared for, 
The feast makes every move a labor.
The feasts where wealth and wit were squandered,
The few who relish toil and teen).
The fields’ and forests’ solitude
The fields with droplets once again), 
The fierce flames reddening the skies.
The fiery glance, he could but find
The fine keen wit of yesteryear 
The fire is out; the ashes, shifting,
The first clear picture is disclosing
The first gay snowflakes spin once more
The first shy rays begin to gleam;
The flash of wit, the flouncing dress.
The floor is oak; two chests, a table,
The flower of life that blooms but once.
numeral; but, to avoid scandal, he decided to number 
The foes stood by, with downcast eyes.
The foes! How long had they been parted
The folly of a simple girl:
The foreign tongue is native to
The friend of Bacchus, Mars, and Venus,
The friend of wintry cottage nights.
The friends, without delaying,
The frightened maiden gathers strength
The frost-work o’er the panes was twining;
The frosts begin to snap, and gleaming
The frozen corpse Zaretzky places.
The frozen funds of intellection —
The furnishings are plain and stable.
Then, in the flower of his youth?
The gamblers, worthy men and bold:
The game he can at last forget;
The gathering, affected by it
The general, since such tributes flatter 
The gentry all cried out in scorn,
The gifts the newcomer possessed;
The girl, stands rooted to the spot*
The girlish secrets of the heart,
’Twixt the maid’s attic and the entry. 
The girls, off by themselves, conspire;
The glitter of the noisy press.
The glories of these frosty days.
The glory’s gone, I know not why;
’Twas thus I sang them — both were dear.
The golden bubbles rising lightly
The golden tongue Italians speak;
The good wdfe took her husband’s measure. 
The gossips ever are malicious,
The grandfathers it promptly urges.
The grove’s asleep. The wind blows chill.
The grove, the bridge, the lake, and on.
The guests’ sly glances were enough.
The guests are early in arriving.
The guests are greeted with delight;
The guests, arriving, hear their laughter. 
The hall is packed to suffocation,
’Twas not the sort of thing he cared for; 
The hammers on the ramrods knock;
The happiness of youth must pass.
The happy man who took no chance
The harbor is a busy sight;
The hat is cocked, the brow morose.
The haughty creatures may inspire
’Twas in a word the Russian blues.
The hazy dawn commences coldly.
The heart of the confirmed coquette!
The heart once more with hope will glow.
The heart recalls its ancient scars,
The heart that thought its fires had dwindled
The heart with virgin tenderness?
The hearth breathes warmth, and all’s serene;
The hearts of both now spurned the flame
The heavens glow with azure light.
The helpless girl can do no more
The herd no longer drives his cattle,
The hero’s named, the work’s begun;
The hero we’re intent upon.
The highroad, leveled altogether,
The hoar-frost in the sun a -shimmer.
The hope on which my heart is fed?
The hopeful youth was quick to find 
The horns and hoofs, the whiskered faces,
The horse who scents him snorts and quivers,
The horses scent the dead, and foam
The horses to an oak near by.
The hostess cries. Guests squeeze together,
The hot fat cutlets; you would say 
The hour called ^^entre chien et loup^^^
The hour for waking and for sleeping;
’Twas here the master used to sit.
The hours go by: they do not waken;
The house hummed like a hive of bees
The house rocks with applause; undaunted,
The housekeeper a slow good-bye;
The husband enters: the appalling
The icy river shows a luster
The idol of all maids in bloom.
The image trembling in the glass
The imps and cupids, quick as monkeys,
The insults time heaps on her head 
The jagged flint still harmless, lifted.
The jesting mixed with flattery . . .
The joys they knew have all proved mortal.
The kindly fates had fancied me.
The ladies’ little feet fly by.
The ladies all pressed closer to her;
The ladies enter; now it’s gliding 
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The ladies, each a picture when
The lady’s lasting admiration
The lady of the house: she’s fled —
The lame Turgenev for his nation
The land that knew my love, my pain, 
The landed gentleman has brought 
The language of the gods rejected . . .
The languor and the flame of love 
The languors of a distant day.
The last chapter of Eugene Onegin was published
The law of Fate is ever just.
The lazy Orient longer dozes.
The leaps, the heels, the whiskers fair. 
The less we love her, sooth to say —
The letter’s ready to be sent;
The letter shakes; she heaves a sigh;
The letter to you quite intact.
The letters that he wrote so neatly,
The lies that journals perpetrate,
The lifting mist reveals the pleasant
The lighted stage, and with a yawn 
The lights, bewildering the rout;
The lily -stem, and withers so
The little feet and lovely limbs;
The little tricks that are affected
The lively Muse was at my side
The loads on the kibitkas sway.
The local Paris: Petushkov,
The lofty madcap! — but no matter:
The lofty passion, the pure pleasure
The lonely gloom was hard to bear.
The lonely thicket where a stream
The loss of it I could not bear.
The loud finale sounds, and pushing,
The lovelorn boy ignored them quite.
The lovely ladies’ filmy dresses.
The lover’s language, the sweet vow,
The lustrous tea-cups, never spilling 
The magazines that like to scold
The magic of the bow obeying,
The maiden lies there, pale as death.
The maids and coachmen vie in swearing; 
The maids would gleefully foretell 
The man? Or vanity, forsooth?
The mansion j&rom its firm foundation
The mansion, hy a hill well hidden,
The marker on the balcony
The marriage-broker kept on pressing
The married rakes, no longer naughty.
The masses of your mountains gleamed,
The master had no need to scold
The masters of the berry -crop.
The matchless bore — on these she mused; 
The matter for a fortnight; oh.
The maxims her mamma has taught.
The meadows’ solitary look,
The men who’d set the peasants free.
The menu hangs there, in plain sight.
The merchant’s wife, so young and slender. 
The merchant, to the port is faring 
The merry and monotonous round.
The messenger was not kept waiting:
The mighty Peter in his youth;
The mind’s reflections coldly noted,
The modern Russian’s worst disease.
The moment that I saw you coming,
The mooB’s enchantment so obsessed her.
The moon has risen; in a light 
The moon her magic vigil kept.
The moon is fading with the night;
The moon, the lampion of heaven.
The most congenial of men.
The mother fell to figuring
The mother groans. "It drives me wild;
The mountain maid, untamed, inspiring,
The music, he would whisper low 
The mystic, wistful hours of night;
The naked woods surprise the sight,
The name-day feast is soon begun.
The nasal twang she also banished.
The neighbor now declares: ''He’s killed.”
The neighbors’ heads and tongues are wagging:
The neighbors promptly called and twaddled
The neighbors, pleasantly diverted,
The newcomers but ape the old;
The news gives Tanya little pleasure.
The nightingale’s keen melodies
The nightingale, this season’s lover,
The noble taste of bygone days.
The noise is queer and terrifying.
The north wind breathes and bellows, driving
The noses blown, and without pause.
The novelist had long since won;
The nurse alone might well have guessed,
The nurse replied: "God save you, daughter!”
The old assessor, paralytic?
’Twas early he learned how to flutter
The old gray nurse thinks she is napping
The old man had no time to look
’Tis yet more pleasant if the creature
The opera summons — in a word,
The orchestra’s already drooping;
The other day in rainy weather
The other slowly circles, thus,
The ox with lowered horns must drag
The oysters? They have come! In rapture
The page he read could scarcely bore him.
The pail is brought, the ice is clinking
The painful dream forever broken!
The pair of us had planned to wander,
The parlor’s crowded; barking pugs,
The parlor hums with conversation,
The passer-by may read it clear:
The passions, though, concerned more often
The pattern of a paragon.
The peddler plods, the merchant dresses,
The pen makes mock of such as he.
The pencil-marks he made with care
The people’s lore of days gone by;
The perishable human crop.
The phrasing, awkward or mistaken,
The pile of books no longer read,
The pines, their boughs on every hand 
The pistols gleam, held straight and steady;
The placid course of rustic leisure;
The plain girl’s love? Why, even now,
The plan I had no pains to settle,
The plans to have been consummated,
The pleasures relished, triumphs thwarted;
The poet’s ardent speech, the mind
The poet’s earliest elation
The poet did not think of stopping
The poet in his exaltation
The poet in the very dawn
The poet is no more ... his lot
The poet lets his pistol fall.
The poet, and he may, forsooth,
The poet, and the world will follow 
The poet, swift in thought and action,
The poet, with impatience burning.
The poisonous vUe worm that mumbles
The polite ”yes” that is behooving.
The poor girl stands there, almost senseless;
The poor old lady, broken-hearted.
Who taught her how to be so lavish
Onegin’s waiting for us now.”
The pranks and jokes of former years.
The press is thick, the hubbub loud.
The prima donna? The ballet?
The prince’s comrade and relation 
The prince invites him to be present 
The princess, and her feeble cries 
The princess, pale, in neglige.
’Tis time: my pen wants rest from driving:
The profile that a move will blur
The promise of her spring was blighted,
The proud lorgnettes the ladies hold
The purling of a gentle brook;
The quarrel grows; Onegin quickly
The queen, aloof, remote, imperious.
The race of men recks nothing, save
The rain of passion is not cruel.
The rapids and the underbrush
The reason doesn’t really matter.)
The relatives — and there are dozens —
The rings are plucked; each maiden, sighing, 
The rings that the new mode dictated.
The river and its banks are leveled;
The road is lost and past divining.
The rogue, who somehow would escape 
The roofs, the fence, all molded fair;
The room grows loud with talk and laughter, 
The room where the old man berated
The room, though not without a sigh.
The rooms are thronged and hot and gay.
The rosy dawn brings forth the sun,
The rustic cyclop labors, daft,
The ruts and ditches that abound
The sad Yakushkin, it would seem,
The same consuming agony.
The samovar, that blest invention,
The saucers of preserve about.
The scene where first I saw your face,
The science of revolt was slow
The science of the tender passion
The sea, the southern sun for basking . . .
’Tis time to seek the southern surges
The secret she will never mention,
The secrets of the nuptial bed;
The senses soon grew blunt and dull.
The servants gather at the gates 
The servants gave him all assistance,
The sex, of course, is light as do’^m.
The shades of night are growing thinner.
The shadows creep across the sill.
The shaggy monster seizes her,
The sharks who feed on gamblers’ passions
The shepherd’s horn awakes the peasant;
The shutters closed, the windows blear
The shutters open; chimneys spout;
The sight of them produces spleen.
The sign with shaking hand, she prayed.
The silence at long last is broken
The silent fields, abandoned, wait,
The silent stars, the brooding moon —
The simple girl whose dreams, whose ways.
The simple lines there graven, she 
The simple talk flows readily.
The sky breathed autumn, somber, shrouded;
The sledge awaits. He does not tarry:
The sleepless fellow’s heart and head.
The sly thrall struggle to be free.
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The snow is reaching to her knee;
The snows still gleaming softly pink,
The soul so shy of happiness;
The sound of Russian when correct;
The sounding waves’ eternal chorus,
The source of tears and happiness.
The spirit of an oddish dreamer.
The splendid mansion shines and gleams, 
The spot itself was God-forsaken.
The square grows lively now and dizzy
The stalls are seething, the pit roars,
The stars of night are fair and many,
The state relied, his friends were told. 
The steward came here when requested;
The storm and strife, the frequent feast; 
The storms which shook it like a leaf
The story of these fragmentary stanzas,
The stove with colored tiles, appealing
The strains of Albion’s proud lyre 
The strait-laced innocent beguile 
The stranger. At her frightened cry,
The street-lamps’ pallid substitute.
The subject of an argmnent?
The subject, give me your attention:
The sudden soimd of hoofs! . . . She freezes.
The sun appears, a brief snow-flurry
The table shone with wax; they handed
The tails and tusks and bloody jaws.
The talk is seasoned well thereafter 
The talk would turn with strange persistence
The tea. I note the hour, or nearly,
The tender feelings and the brave?
The tender leaves, but in the spring 
The tender torments, and the sadness, 
The tender verse. Princess Pauline;
The terraced scene, the view unfolding 
novel by Mme. Cottin, an eighteenth-century writer; 
The theatre’s wicked legislator.
The theme from which he ne’er departed
The thing that makes the world go round.
The things that I concoct in lonely
The third day interest abated
The thirst for knowledge, toil, and fame.
The thoughts of youth so high and grave.
The three kibitkas customary
The throng with a mute eye commanding?
The time came when he quite abhorred
The time had come — she was in love.
The time of tempting nights approaches,
The time run on, and in the middle
The times improve, and better us!
The tinsel of unwelcome days,
The tom-cat calls the tabby
The tone the gentlemen employed,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The touching glasses chime and clink.
The trace you left has long since perished
The traveler observes and shivers 
The tread of passion augurs tears:
The treasure none can ever guess,
The trees in wintry silver gleamed;
The truest source of inspiration:
The truth, and, God be praised, can see 
The tune, however, threatens her;
The tw"o explore the garden’s charm.
The two Skotinins, gray as sages.
The two friends’ greetings; and the tears 
The two old women weep, embrace.
The unconcerned beloved anew.
The vapor wreathes the china pot.
The verses came — but who would know it? —
The version of it given here 
The very boon they would petition,
The very hero of our novel!
The very plains where Wittgenstein
The very words Onegin wrote.
The view into the moonlit night.
The village, where Onegin’s leisure
The vintage of the comet flows.
The vision of a peerless girl,
The vista of a free romance!
The voice of mistress, foe, and friend,
The volumes at long last succeeding 
The war, the snow-fall, and his mate.
The waters, where they boil and toss;
The way a Russian verse is turned.
The weak would mend life’s fraying thread;
The well-known clubman, who, God bless us, 
The while Zaretzky with a sneer
The while she howls both long and loud;
The while we hear the woodland sing?
The whist -players are Hon-hearted:
The whole day through in solitude.
The will to rule is seen thus early:
The wind, would enter, gently warning
The window, where he read it through.
’Tis time to loose me from my tether;
’Tis thus the gay dog’s thoughts are freighted,
The wolf beside his hungry mate.
The women mowing oft repair
The woods, Tatyana stayed at home,
The word is one I can’t translate:
The words again with stifled moan.
The world’s oblivious animation.
The world of glory thus bereaving,
The world without, Tatyana crept.
The world would gain if it should learn 
The world, the ball, are both forgot,
The wretched story out, complete —
The year’s bright dawn with gentle greeting.
The years to rugged prose constrain me.
The young Othello is delighted!
The young and hopeful brides-to-be,
The young tell fortimes, all are jolly.
The younger beauties will declare
The youth was called on every hand
The youthful heart; I will defy
Their arms about each other, creep 
Their conquests and their pranks with glee;
Their daughters, after due embraces.
Their endlessly protracted caU.
Their gestmes marked by firm decision,
She falls . . .
Their judgment both men freely gave.
Their looks enchant, their words are sweet, 
Their love, though tempests fill the air.
Their mark the temple or the thigh.
Their marriage was a certainty.
Their masters wearily berating.
Their meetings passed; in turn they spoke
Their monocles that rake the guests.
Their nags, huts, mansions, monasteries,
Their news, their gossip — all arc stale.
Their pangs, and he, remote from love,
Their rapid bubbles hissing still;
Their steaming cups have barely stirred 
Their very slander has no color;
Their voices, and their words were kind, 
Them both aside and only for a 
Themselves to find out his intent.
Then I required, as I protested,
Then Olga’s suitor paid a visit.
Then Russia did as she was bidden.
Then all is changed. For lo! she veers,
Then at the rug that decks the bed,
Then buzzing, all sit down to dine.
Then dipped into some vile review.
Then disappointed beyond measure, 
Then fell again to talking of
Then flash with pride and flame with anger, 
Then he came up to her and said: 
Then he presents the madrigal.
Till Lensky, too absorbed to look,
Then let each man be on his mettle:
Then liking grew: they met each day
Then muttered on in ecstasy.
Then plunged into domestic labors:
Then they demand in compensation
’Tis pleasant with a wicked sally
Then what a poem I’ll contrive 
Then you will weep, but who supposes
Then, aiming at his pallid brow.
Then, at a party he attends
Then, hurry, hurry to the fields!
Nor calls them, noons, for mustering;
Theocritus and Homer bored him ;
The gallants for their hostess vying.
There’s gloom and darkness all about;
There’s little here that’s exquisite.
There Muravyov showed pluck and force,
When every walk fresh wonders yields;
There Shakovskoy brought noisy laughter
There a Circassian’s horse goes flying;
There are no inns. In a cold cottage
There at her feet, as they would do.
There bold Fonvizin, freedom’s friend,
There is a dinner-party daily
There is a quickening at the root
There is a roaring in her ears . . .
There is no answer to his letter;
There is no calumny so deep.
There is no notion so erratic.
There is no sleep for such as she.
There is no sparkle here of wit;
There is the spot if you would know it:
There may the lyre sound clear and free,
There one can make a declaration,
There other things were done and bruited.
There pours in torrents from his pen 
There sings all night; wild roses cover
There the Petrovsky Palace, hiding
There the impassive general
There was a time when the impassioned
There was a time when the portrayal
There, when the tardy moon was shining. 
There, wistful-eyed, behold her stand,
Thereby our eighteen-year -old sage.
Therewith a bottle of light wine,
These artless lines can never bore me.
These friends! ’tw^as not for nothing that 
These guests, and somehow keeps her seat.
novel by Louvet de Couvrai, an eighteenth-century 
These proud reflections all portend:
These spoke to her with silent force.
These warnings in your ears are dinned 
These were the secret fond traditions
They’d come to an old aunt, now failing —
They’d sup, then time for sleep drew nigh.
They’ll cock the trigger and let fly,
They’re duller than the things we write.
They’ve played eight rubbers at a stretch.
They are so clever, so serene.
They bark and whistle, sing and screech. 
They came into my mind so pat.
They chase the dogs away, alert
They chew. The pleasant prandial chink
They chortle, argue, shout and squeak.
They climg as brother clings to brother.
They come, they conquer, and they flee.
They come. Quite unaffected still.
They cross themselves, their heads incline,
They dared not let their voices drop:
They do not change, depend upon it.
They eye our heroine askance.
They face Tatyana, who is paler
They find her odd — so unaffected.
What verse, what talk, how fair a dream!
They glow, they burn, the ecstasies
They gossiped on, in high good humor.
They had their private meetings, whether
They had to travel for a week.
They hitch them to the master’s sleigh; 
They learned, and we, before we leave.
They like to fill a man with fear.
They liked to tread a country measure;
They look like fenceposts, flashing by.
They loosed my braids, and singing low
They loved the good old ways, and wallowed
They married her sans her consent.
They met; except that both were human.
They only sent him off to sleep.
They rouse are those of youthful kisses, 
They say that life does not afford
They say the ladies should read Russian,
They set a table laid for two;
They settled dowm on his estate.
They sought to make love’s ties more binding 
They still can thrill me in my dreams.
They stop because the servants fetch 
They take her to the Club for dances.
They too were of their duties heedful,
They touch the springs of reverie.
About the weather, flax, and cattle . . .”
They travel homeward quickly, choosing.
They traveled, but a dull hour passed 
They vanish, claimed by the unknown;
They waltz, they bow, they curtsey, flitting
They were unlike as any two men:
They whisper: ^’Dimya, pay attention!”
Thick coffee Orientals prize:
Thinking of Eugene all the while.
Thinks sadly: ''Why am I not ailing.
Thirty -two paces with precision;
This Martin Zadeka, it seems,
This clever jester had to suffer.
This ditty sounds for Tanya’s ring:
This estimable friend embracing.
This ever -rapturous hero, burning
This giddy play in fancy-dress.
This horseman the Pope consecrated,
This insult was not to be borne.
This is no rhetoric I’m using:
This learned opus one fine day 
This pool we bathe in, friends, this muck 
This strange and sorry character,
This subject filled his conversations.
This too was the old master’s nook;
This warlike rover who was fated
This way is of all fates the worst.
This whiskered regiment diverted
Thither she came to sport and sing
Those fleshy anchorites alive 
Those gentle hands were stained with gore
Those lovely lips; is it not true?
Thou epic Muse! Upon my way
Though Eugene lent a willing ear.
Though I was worthy your belief,
Though great, the poet’s not conceited.
Though he pursued, the chase was palling; 
Though he was brave, though he was gifted,
Though innocent, are quite absurd.
Though it is true your recollection 
Though it suggests a peasant’s hovel,
Though now a light of no repute.
Though on occasion hke a duffer
Though once they praised my magic pen:
Though there are people, most malicious,
Thought sermons fashioned to annoy;
Thoughts of the future made him whistle;
Three ladies mention a soiree.
Three pairs of truly pretty feet.
Three-fifty was the price bespoken,
Through empty day and idle night:
Through lofty tree-tops everywhere;
Through silent woods, and she discovers 
Through spectacles, with failing eyes,
Through the dim room where I am sitting.
Thus Eugene thought with melancholy.
Thus Lensky his good Mend defended.
Thus a gray hare will quake with fright 
Thus a poor moth imprisoned seeks
Thus autumn gusts deal death and treason.
Thus brilliantly begins the ball.
Thus darkly drives the storm that shrouds 
Thus far away her thoughts are flying;
Thus grows a seed the earth has hidden 
Thus he grew restless and decided
Thus once again he manifested
Thus people, frankly I confess,
Thus sunk in reveries, he nearly
Thus to rush forth, then lapse in quiet
Thus you, Yazykov, when affection
Thus, for an evening game of whist,
Till from his dressing-room he’d pass.
Then he suggests they sit one out.
Till somehow the long evening’s ended,
Till travel, as you’ll have inferred,
Time was when all the world was vying
Time was when she would be composing
To -write in French . , . What’s to be done? 
To 0 . . . our neighbor. Oh, but he
To Eugene, who at once goes dancing 
To Lensky’s wrath: he would not see
To Moscow: it’s the brides’ bazaar;
To Olga’s voice: away she went,
To Olga. First they spin about.
To Olga: "I am happy— no?”
To Tanya of the days that were;
To a new pose will he be goaded,
To a toilette you must admire,
To an ambitious author’s whims:
To answer when the lady speaks.
To ask Anisya for the key.
To be his relative’s sole heir.
To be united to his own,
To brush the shy lips of a maiden 
To call it dirty is no lie.
To call that friend of freedom wrong.
To cast forced shade upon the street.
To choose such moral tales as might 
To classicism doffed my hat:
To come today, and without fail.
To crowding slaves on every side?
To darkness’ kind abode repairing,
To decent folk, and with a smile.
’Tis morning; all the world’s astir:
To do full justice to the table,
To drink a toast to his fair neighbor,
To drown the jealous whispering.
To dwell on sorry things so long.
To earn a luncheon from the two,
To face our foes as all men must,
Ethiopian.
To find a Moscow magazine
To flowery field and village sport,
To flute and viol’s merry sound.
To follow you with deep devotion;
To fondle either parent never
To free its wings, and frantic, pushes
To friend and child and faithful wife;
To gather tribute from the dell.
To get it, friends, do you recall?
To give me over to despair.
To go: he had no wish to stay.
To gossip to about the city
To gossip; but her heart would fill 
To grasp things . . . But you’re growing pale;
To hang upon the young bloods’ tales.
To hapless Tanya . . . Well, and so 
To have our roads completely mended, 
To have two friends at daggers drawn 
To have your humble servant tell
To hear a people’s hymn of praise.
To hear a voice cry: ^'Well? He’s killed.” 
To hear the vulgar chatter there.
To her a tiresome thing she dreamed. 
To her dear hero she addresses.
To her to whom his heart belongs,
To her vain passion day by day;
To him of whom indeed I sing . . •
To him; and thereby sadly daunted, 
To his Tatyana makes his way.
To his assassins without ruth.
To his dear charmer his own verses?
To his estate about this time 
To his sharp judgments, sullen wit.
To hold the pistol straight and steady;
To holding poets’ sweet inventions.
To horse’s stamp and human speech!
To humble kings and make them fawn.
To hurry them: he cannot wait.
To join the hateful worldly flurry.
To keep his hopeless ledgers clear.
To kiss the breast with languor laden;
To know Onegin really well.
When he was calling on an aunt 
To learn my Eugene’s air of scorn.
To leave . . . Our Eugene could not stir.
To leave such quiet haunts as these 
To leave, is gone; they let time slip 
To let the tender habit seize me;
To let the worldlings take the measure
To liken do-re-mi to wine.
To listen to you, late and soon;
To long to clasp your knees, and, throbbing
To love all ages owe submission;
To love and idleness devoted.
To make a guest exclaim at it.
To make a lasting deep impression.
To make a man feel like an ass,
’Tis here, to please a lavish whim,
To make the soul of man rejoice 
To masquerade in male attire.
To me all this is naught. This minute
To me alone he dedicated! . . .’?
To meet his fathers speedily;
To merchants; we have but one fear:
To method, he would not allow 
To mist her wide and tender eyes.
To mourn his absence, and in vain.
To move you even while you slept;
To my old nurse, my childhood’s friend;
To no one, friends, you must believe me:
To one who is but half-alive:
Our native tongue turns up its nose
To one whose soul has perished, and 
To overhear what they may say.
To play a game of cards with me,
To play with tender reveries.
To plunge their tinkling pitchers there,
To poetry’s exalted flame;
To praise his mind if not his heart,
To praise the dancer now the rage,
To praises imaccustomed grown.
To prink and preen he’d ask no urging,
To promenade, as all do daily.
To reading, where a finger-nail 
To rest from loads I used to bear.
To rest the nags: the halts were boring. 
To roam the forests, green and deep.
To save his honor stood quite ready 
To say, with sorrow in her eyes:
To scan the flags and see what sails 
To scratch her neck, and stubbornly
To see a pedant in a bonnet!
To sit beside an invalid!
To sketch a woman’s legs or head.
To sleep upon the stove.
To soil the sheets with flying quill;
To stand, dear vision, by my bed?
To stormy gaiety a traitor,
To suffer prison, and would fly 
To sunny gardens’ fragrant toil;
To tag each other, or to roam 
To take aim also — ^but just then 
To take the awful cargo home.
To take the letter up and seal it 
To talk and sigh, to jest or grieve
To tempt the sporting man of fashion.
To tempt with tender word and sigh
To tender him the Kremlin keys.
To the inviting sea would fly.
She gazes at him without pause . . .
In his first youth he w'as the prey
From two to thirty, in a row;
To these long letters and these tears.
Should see how lovely she has grown!
To think the girl that he adored
To this half-Russian, German-bred.
To this were fribbling hours devoted,
To travel, you must be desiring 
To use her own, and hence they had 
To utter, yet she’d not a trace.
To wander by the lake at leisure,
To wash his face with careful paw,
To watch the swans in some dim valley 
To which we vowed our walks apart,
’Mongst thinkers who are few and cloudy, 
To whom these faces all appear
To whom your pensive verse belong?”
To win her — showed her such attention! 
To youthful hearts its tempests bring
Today it is my turn to speak.
Together in the forest gloaming;
Together nudge Tatyana and
Together we have traveled far.
Took punishment once in a way.
Took wilful passion for my guide;
Torment the rhymesters a la mode.
Touched by the careless twittering,
Toward the moon her languid gaze,
Towers above the craggy hills,
Town that’s delivered to the flood,
Transparent veil the sky is muffled.
Travels how different a road —
Triquet turns, with his sheet, to her,
Triquet; next follow two adepts:
Truly, a beatific land.
Tufted with snow; the stars are shining 
Tug at the leather rein, and turning
Tulchin, where the Spring shines betimes. 
Tumansky in sonorous stanzas
’’Stop crying, stop this tiresome quacking 
Tutored by her own wit — she duly 
Two Petriads, and a collection
Two days he found it quite diverting:
Two fluffy furrows as it races;
Two girls would come, and sadly twining 
Two hearts, a torch, and flowers, be sure, 
Two hearts, one may perhaps believe.
Two merchants have already met.
Two minutes passed with neither speaking,
Two slender boughs are flung across
Two-legged millions are our tools;
’Mid maids and matrons seems to glide
Unbidden guests; the scene abashes 
Undressed at last and went to bed.
Unheeded in her great dark eyes.
Unhesitatingly she ran.
Unless indeed we send a card
No rung would suit him but the top —
Unspoiled by the vain show and fleeting
Until Breguet’s unsleeping chime
Until a great discovery
Until the flames blazed up anew
Until, near dawn, his head was dropping 
Unutterably dear and fair.
Up through the flue the pipe -smoke passes; 
Up to its roof was past all praise. 
Up to the steps, in coach and shay, 
Upon ''ideal” — modish word —
Yawned through the long thanksgiving mass,
Upon a fair Venetian face,
Upon a succulent fat pie
Upon a trailing branch suspended
Upon each other’s necks they fall.
Upon her balcony alone
Upon her heart, as though a rumbling 
Upon her shamed and flaming cheeks;
Upon her tray a steaming cup:
Upon her wrath her lips are sealed.
Upon his brow the mark of death,
Upon his sledge tries out the road;
Upon its staples, not on gold —
Upon my dreaming soul intrude.
Upon the azure, pale and tender.
Upon the bachelor’s sad existence;
Upon the banks by Dnieper raided,
Upon the boards still flutter free,
Upon the chapters in your hand, 
Upon the couch, a riding-crop.
Upon the dam leaned Lensky, waiting.
Upon the death of his dear father
Upon the distant hills lay light.
Upon the dull mind’s slumbers break.
Upon the finished product then;
Upon the floor Triquet we view 
Upon the good old-fashioned ways 
Upon the granite parapet.
Upon the magic of that stream —
Upon the nameless river’s shore
Upon the oak her tufts are hung;
Upon the pages everywhere 
Upon the parlor sofa lies
Upon the patriarchal dust,
Upon the sharp -clawed paw he offers,
Upon the steppes that it invaded,
Upon the stove the cat elected
Upon the streets the snow is lying,
Upon the table gleam the glasses,
Upon the table, piping hot;
Upon the third of January,
Upon the threshold of his grave.
Upon the urn, and think: Til -fated!
Upon those lines of bis commending 
Upon those very boards thereafter.
Upon voluptuous rugs instead.

’May I but live to see the day!
Wades through the streets, if he but can;
Walked to the stream below the hill; 
Wants one thing further, more’s the pity;
Was all the art of love required.
Was bold enough to challenge you —
Was bored again beyond all measure; 
Was bored with everything he tried,
Was but a boy, if truth were told.
Was ever harder task invented?
Was he the carefree soul he seemed?
Was it not thus I long since spent
Was it not you who gently gave me
Was jesting subtly and displaying 
Was love: he sang it late and soon,
Was one that I found exquisite.
Was our morose Tatyana’s way.
Was pleasure happiness in sooth
Was quite the rustic engineer.
Was reverie; she wreathed with dream 
Was sleeping, heedless of the clock;
Was the interpreter of dreams.
Was the sad singer shocked to learn 
Was then our ruler, as you know.
Was to a single occupation;
Was to be readily forgot.
Was with Tatyana — ^not, forsooth,
Was wooed by passionate young devils*
Was yet a thorough Russian; hence
Watched fondly, in seclusion growing,
We’ll go together , . . Oh, my chest! . . .
We’ll listen to the forest voices.
We’ll split apart the mountain ridges,
We’re all Napoleons, we’re certain —
We’re put to sleep by moral tales;
We both had played with passion, early
We both had wearied of the game;
We buy with timber and with tallow:
’'Something detained him. He intended 
We can’t please the fastidious.
We careless fellows leave the fretting
’’Your name is — what?” He passes on.
We loved them, though, when we were young
We met by chance; /, though^ perceiving
We need the wit that nature gave us 
We scared patrols with blatant noise;
We shall have arched, cast-iron bridges
We show at aU times due respect,
We sing about a lucky maid.
We think good wishes are the thing.
We were in reverie transported.
We win the game that w^e are playing.
We won good old Derzhavin’s blessing
We yet attend upon the word
We yielded to delicious dreaming.
Wearied by what he had desired.
Wearing a look of self-possession,
Well I remember waves in riot
Well, must you go now? Not so fast!
’’Write odes, odes only, gentlemen,
Went forth, in dress — a London dandy.
Went off and talked in solemn wise;
Went raving mad or worse: became 
Wept o’er her daughter as they parted,
Were all of them, as well you know.
Were all unconsciously revealing:
Were banished by her animation,
Were bliss; and death? I should not fear it!
Were greeted, with almost dismaying
Were in no instance trained upon her,
Were it not better, if before
Were ladies of a certain age,
Were proper people to engage;
Were set upon those casks of wine.
Were signs and warnings to confound her — 
Werther, to be a martyr fated,
What’s said beside the fading fire.
What London haberdashers hallow
What anguished longing held me fast!
What are her reveries unspoken?
What biting words the rogue would utter
What came of it: Always prepared.”
What dazzling hopes awhile are yours.
What difference does that make to me?
What does my future hold in store?”
What hidden meaning in it lies.
What is he? A mere imitation,
What is it? Water! And this lack 
What languor fills her lovely breast!
What languor in her magic glances!
What more is asked? The world is warm
What more, my friends, do you demand? 
What of it? Though his eyes were busy,
What of the tryst, then, so iU-fated?
What passage, what remark delighted
What petty thought? What trivial feeling? 
What pride, what grief, what thoughts of her!
What shipments are in quarantine?
What sight thus fills him with dismay?
What such a nightmare signifieso 
What talk of famine, plague, or war?
What tears I shed you do not know.
What the word relatives embraces.
They gallop snorting o’er the snow.
Or when through liveried throngs he’s thrusting
Kishinev in the autumn of 1822 to his brother; "/e
Indoors, the maid will softly sing
I throw myself on your compassion . . .
And w^ept his father and his mother . . .
All hustle, bustle, tell great lies,
Turn pale or blush, as one distressed . . .
When I was but a tiny boy!
When I was gone three years, and wandered 
When I was young — a mere suggestion ...”
When Tanya’s tender message came;
When a fine lady seeks to win me 
When all the foreign cooks were bent 
When all went out to say farewell,
’’Once in those arms I lay contented,
When at my tasks of charity.
When dawn’s fiirst ray had barely shown;
When destiny brought us together?
When evening comes he will repair.
French writer.
When guests arrive she pays no heed.
There Pestel ... for the tyrants . . .
When he had come, and if, of late.
When he lies deaf to your appeal?
She sought the path, but as she turned, 
Once dwelt, two pines are intertwined —
Iv There fancies bloom and dreams run riot —
Is southern winter’s travesty;
I . . . I’m in love,” she murmured low.
'T am not known here. He is gone . . .
When on the grass in Spring it’s pressed,
To know you: spirit tuned to spirit;
When on the ground you see him, stricken. 
When once again, inspired, ecstatic,
When once the breath of spring assails me, 
When passion’s fires no longer smolder,
When scarce a lad, his heart was captured —
When shall I meet the girl at last
When springtime’s sun shines warm above: 
Pushkin’s day.
When suddenly they’re visited
When sweetly through the doors and surely 
When the cool messenger of morning.
When the deep shades of night are thinning:
When there’s no duty on the wine?
When they discussed some weighty matter,
When they employed the mother-tongue;
When two feet tripped toward their lover! 
When we see him nearing us.
When we were bowed beneath the rod 
When will you lose remembrance of them?
By any wife who’s virtuous.
When with diaphanous pale light
When writing his extravaganzas
When writing that intelligent,
When, a Lyceum lad, I flourished.
When, wrapped in storm, shall I be battling
Where’er it goes, I am its lover:
Where’s youth (the rhyme comes glibly) banished? 
Where I can . . .” "Ah, another pretty
Where I would loll, without a goal, 
Where Russia’s czar was king of kings.
Where Tanya’s met with ”oh-s” and ”ah-s,” 
Where Tanya met him face to face.
Where Thalia as she’s gently napping 
Where all is silent, dark and drear.
Where are the storms of love and longing.
Where did her sister take her grief?
Where did she learn this wild excess?
Where entertainment was but scant;
Where go, you madman, to forget?
Where guests disperse, or at a ball!
Where he had met her ravished gaze.
Where is compassion, where confusion?
Where is he? Y'es, I know the one.”
Where is the burning agitation.
Where is the noble aspiration.
Where is the saturnine betrayer,
Where is your Mend?” the hostess said;
Where lindens hide the lovers well;
Where long my buried heart has lain.
Where love burned like a living coal.
Where moonlight silvered shrub and stone, 
Where old Neva’s gray waters flow,
Where she, with God knows who for neighbors.
Where should I seek a dearer treasure?
Where spelling has been sadly spited,
Where still the bloody ghost pursued.
Where the maids sang to keep from cheating
Where the quick sunbeams on it play,
Where to, God knows; she never said.
Where will my naughty lad repair?
Where winds and tempests were forbidden,
Where winter-long you were so gay;
Where you were born, or, as a beau.
Where, in the shadow of the wings.
Where, on a rustic bench at last
Where, set in alphabetic order.
Whereby the mind or heart is shaken.
Wherein agreeable vice prevails.
Wherever there is Russian ground.
Which he declaims with ecstasy
Which nowadays seems somewhat queer.
Which ripens fairly, but to drop;
Which told him that his uncle lay 
While Cicero could scarcely please;
While I lie lapped in rural peace!
While doctors hemmed and women cried.
While in due time Monsieur replaced her,
While in the doorway took his station —
While in the garden’s lavish shade 
While into town the milkmaid presses, 
While our sad rhymesters earn a kick?"
While round the tents that nomads raise
While the dull husband, fully knowing 
While we, with married life not smitten. 
While wildly aU the fiddles sing
While winter’s carpet, softly shining.
While with his clumsy Russian hammer
While, on the other hand, his wife
Whispers an outworn compliment,
White hand he swiftly smoothed his hair, 
Whither Onegin in a flurry
Who’s had three thousand years of praise.
Who best knows how to separate.
Who by the high gods’ will is fated
Who called him everything that’s vicious 
Who cannot feel: he is too clever.
Who does not drain the brimming cup,
Who early found both death and glory.
Who fathered the vast universe.
Who hear November at the gate.
Who is inspired in his distress:
Who likes a bribe as much as meat.
Who loves you more may write yet more.”
Who neither crack nor are a joke!
Who never longed and never hated.
Who sees the dark on every hand?
Who thought our Eugene was a gull;
The poor thing nearly swoons; she’s ill.
Who tmto every fascinator
Who vanished like the shades of dawn . . .
Who was the fair young poet’s slayer?”
Who will assent to all we say?
Who will not seek our faults to flout us?
Who will not spread vile lies about us? 
Who will not weary us, with speed?
Who will recall my poor creations.
Who will supply our every need?
Who would not tire of threats and rages,
Who would not weary of evasion.
Who, in this cool majestic woman.
Who, lulling reason, comes to rest
Who, yawning, with his friends and wife.
Whoever you may be, my reader,
Whole families of neighbors driving
Whom fame had, by strange chance, been sunning.
Whom silence was about to throttle,
Whom, at the start of our romance,
"What ails you?” "Nothing.” So — away.
Whose days are living poetry —
Whose heart belonged to other days.
Whose heart experience has chilled,
Whose hearts the years at length anneal; 
Whose peasants live in beggary;
Whose posture was of one defeated.
Whose satisfactions were, through life, 
Whose secret solace on the heart
Whose shade across the mill-pond lies 
Whose soul was shaped in Gottingen, 
Why do you pay me these attentions? 
Why don’t I travel with a crutch.
Why is Tatyana an offender?
’’He never puts a civil face on.
’’He’s coming?” But in silence basking.
Why not? You can have no objection.
Why set two ages thus at odds?
Why should you have such veneration
Why thus dispense with lawful labor?
Wili cure the lad, for good or ill.
Will be the subject of my story.
Will bravely face the stake, nor wax 
Will feel her heart with pity burning.
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Will it no more return to me?
Will look with scorn on my distress!
Will love again. But self-control,
Will not debate and ponder it
Will not your soul be filled with rue
Will square accounts, whoever falls.
Will tell the story of your fate.
Will you not come to shed a tear

Wind-tossed, and all too soon decay.
Wine of the Don, to drink a toast.
Winter, the sorceress, ’tis she!
With Eugene, and with him alone.
With French it’s spotted like a leopard —
With Lensky’s fate is occupied;
With Ozerov’s grave lines and tragic. 
With a French volume in her hand.
With a feigned chill in look and voice. 
With a fine mind and handsome face;
With a gay jest and words untrue.
With a too wanton kind of fun.
With all a dandy’s mind can limn.
With anguish, pour out at your feet 
With ardent words, and how to ravish 
With blotted rhyme and criss-cross kiss — 
With caution through the key -hole spying
With chairs and chests and casseroles,
With chalk. No knock can ever waken 
With cocks in cages (these one slaughters
With dancing blood, with living heat.
With dignity brings forth his lay.
With drooping head and languid bearing
With easy grace of this and that.
With ecstasy, but with regret.
With every church in bright attire.
With every jealous word he reckoned,
With fiery imagination.
With flame that fails as it appears;
With flashing eyes Onegin rises
With flattering pen and heart aglow.
With foreign words; their frequency 
With frowning brow he would be sitting 
With her Onegin at her side —
With her neat monogram in wax.
With him the humble road of life.
With his last victory, awaited 
With his own pawn takes his own rook.
With his own self dissatisfied.
With his red belt and sheepskin coat.
With his sardonic comedies;
With hope, then prove it an illusion,
With its unseasonable strife 
With jams and featherbeds and bowls.
With jealousy revive it next.
With joy the contemplative soul!
With kindly hand the old man’s bays.
With lampions bright on sills and ledges
With laughter and with noisy sport.
With lowered horns, a lonely deer;
With most folk, custom’s rule prevails.
With most polite and cool address,
With motley figures: people dart
With none to understand or cherish
Tatyana’s
With olden days and doddering nurses:
With other children scarcely ever.
With other days come other dreams,
With perfect fireedom she receives him;
With pipe alight you’d find me sipping
With proud perukes and red-heeled shoes.
With pure devotion, knew no bliss 
With rebel will and lively mind.
With roaming flocks was lightly spotted;
With rosy light the eastern skies,
With scorn; yet smiles upon the lips 
Be she? It is . . . But no . . . And yet . . .
With shouts and plaudits. Tanya now 
With sighs I think, bemused adorer,
With silver hoar, the meadows lie . . • 
With skill and passion, touch and smile.
With solemn gait and sparkling eye.
With sorrow, but her tears were brief.
With splendor unaccustomed eyes.
With stormy passion’s heat she blazes;
With studied ways amused the crowd
With sudden passion, sudden pain . . .
With tea and jam, and endless tattle
With the avow'als of a boy.
With the coarse salt of malice, while 
With the ninth wave the ship’s arriving
With them, a red-wigged man in glasses:
With those Chateaubriand could write;
With two or three bright -backed imported 
With us, but grows apace; indeed, 
With utmost speed Onegin dresses,
not clear what moved him to make these omissions. 
With you, nor yet with you who spin 
Within me — they have found surcease:
Within my garden, unexpected;
Within the gondola’s embrace
Within the hill -encircled valley
Within, a noisy clatter swells;
Within, you hear the feet still pounding.
Without a tavern of its own.
Without affairs, or rank, or wife,
Without them, there’s no paradise.
Worthy of him I am addressing,
Would always give three balls a year;
Would be dismayed to see him there;
Would be in every way far better 
Would chide him, would forgive him soon.
Would cite a verse he had by heart,
Would dare to seek that gentle girl?
Would dream of walking, bride and wife.
Would drop so tenderly at even . . .
Would fail to show Diana gleaming,
Would fly the place: she cannot stir;
Would gallop side by side with me!
Would grow more ardent very often,
’’Farewell, the days of peace are past; 
Would make the den her library.
Would ravish one who prized the treasure
Would scarcely call intelligent.
Would show him every friendliness; 
Would start a quarrel quite as shrewdly, 
Would turn quite taciturn with languor, 
Would, in a body, call at eve.
Would, tete-a-tete, where no one heard.

Yes, deep within I had the feeling.
Yes, jealousy’s attacks can seize us
Yes, now the door is opened for them,
Yet all is well — each has its due:
Yet bidding the poor girl adieu,
Yet grieve for him . . . But wherefore grieve?
Yet in vain boredom I am wasting
Yet soon they let down their defences.
Yet, as a rule, despised mankind;
You’d find the way of vice was hard,
You’d give him Adam Smith to read.
You’ll bid us free, to speed our task,
You’ll grant it’s time to part, my dears.
’’Correct; you’ll bring for our inspection 
You also, youthful belles, belated
You are an early bird! Last night
You are the helpmeet I’d be choosing:
You are to come, and named the day.”
You came and lectured me so coldly —
You came in dreams: I feared to waken,

You dwell in dreams, and you persist 
You handsome albums decorated
You haunts where I might stay in hiding. 
You have a Russian family setting,
You have a fever . . .” "Fever, no:

You lectured me, I listened, meek;
You looked in at the house just twice
You made me drunk in other days.
You may dismiss them as unfit
You may expect no less firom me;
You may rely upon the fair,
You men who lived in wedded bliss
You might be pleased — if so, advise me —
You mothers, as your own once did.
You prove you know, beyond a doubt,
You rustic Priams, and you gentle
You scarce can get a dish of pottage:
You seek: be it extravaganzas 
You shone as with a nuptial splendor:
You should perceive udth eye severe 
You sigh, and think with farrowed brow —
You smooth his pillow and contrive

You, figments of sweet reverie.

You, you alone would be my wife.
Young Olga coming to make tea,
Young Olga was the first to stir;
Young Tanya, whom I still hold dear.

Your dreams, your high simplicity.
Your frank avow-al touched me nearly.
Your friendship.” At this invitation 
Your grief wall bring me to remorse?
Your heart responded how? Pray, tell!
