’'Something detained him. He intended 
’May I but live to see the day!
’Mid all the conquests that he vaunted? 
’Mid maids and matrons seems to glide
’Mongst thinkers who are few and cloudy, 
’Tis here, to please a lavish whim,
’Tis morning; all the world’s astir:
’Tis pleasant with a wicked sally
’Tis thus the gay dog’s thoughts are freighted,
’Tis time to loose me from my tether;
’Tis time to seek the southern surges
’Tis time: my pen wants rest from driving:
’Tis yet more pleasant if the creature
’Twas early he learned how to flutter
’Twas here the master used to sit.
’Twas in a word the Russian blues.
’Twas not the sort of thing he cared for; 
’Twas thus I sang them — both were dear.

”0h, there will be a dreadful babble,

”Ah, nurse, I know you won’t refuse me.”
”Ah, nurse, your mind is not in question.
”And this is my Tatyana.” 'Taney!
”But for a season it will do;
”But ruin at his hands is sweet,”
”But, nurse, you still can tell me of
”Dear me, the years have just flown by!”
”Don’t think . . . but really . . . don’t accuse me . . .
”God knows how gladly, only say it . . .”
”Here you will find the master’s den.
”How Tanya’s grown! Why, how long is it
”I should most dearly like to see.”
”It’s like a novel . . . life’s so chancey • . .”
”Move up the table, give me paper,
”No, nobody! You’re quite secure,
”Not on my income, more’s the pity!”
”Of maids and creatures superhuman?
”She’s mine!” cries Eugene, stern and daring;
”Sit down, mon angeS ”My dear Cousine!'^
”The fireplace, miss, please look at it — 
”Then bid your grandson — don’t delay it —
”This silly landscape! Never mind;
”Too late,” he thinks. ”And then that vicious

”Yes, after all these years. Aline!”
”You are the one that I adore.

"A story?” asked the good old woman,
"Agreed.” "Now that is good of you!”
"Ah, but the elegy is flighty.
"Ah, nurse, nurse darling, I am hounded 
"Ah, then you know him?” "Yes, and no.”
"But it’s a bore, my firiend, that’s clear.”
"But tell me who she is.” "My wife.”
"But you were married, nurse,” said Tanya,
"Dear, you are ill,” the old nurse muttered.
"Farewell, you dear and peaceful valleys,
"Forgive me. Prince, but can you not
"Good-bye, Onegin, I must go.”
"Has he grown tame at last, and mellow?
"He lives in Moscow. Last December
"How was it?” "By God’s will, my Vanya 
"I am in love,” poor Tanya uttered
"I am in love; leave me alone.”
"I cannot grasp it. I’ll be betting
"I cannot help it: I am weeping . . .
"I lived, by strangers quite surrounded.
"I must confess, though loth to hurt you,
"I see no harm in that; I’m grateful.”
"I shan’t detain you; but where is it
"If I were one of those w-ho rather
"Let’s go.”
"My child, you’re ill! The Lord have mercy!
"No.” "Gladly.” "When?” "At once. You’ll see
"She sat beside the window. She
"The ray of dawn will shine tomorrow,
"Then, far from Moscow’s noise and glitter.
"These evenings? At the Larins’.” "Splendid.
"Well, shall we start?” The young Othello
"What’s to be done? She’s not a child,”
"What ails you?” "Nothing.” So — away.
"What! only solemn odes? Just quote them:
"When did he get here, by the bye?
"Why do you say so?” "Not a feature 
"You love the younger? Curious creature!”
"Your fashionable world is hateful;

' ’Vladimir Lensky slumbers here.
'"^Make way! Make way!” along they fly.
''As in the old days poets wrote them —
''But tell me, which one is Tatyana?”
''Can it, indeed,” thinks Eugene, ''can it
''Get up,” he cried, "Past six, I vow,
''My second?” Eugene said, "Permit me;
''Princesses ’Tachettel I can’t believe it!”
''Then I was younger, maybe better,
''What notions! You may find it blameless.
'T am not known here. He is gone . . .
'T cannot sleep, nurse; it is stifling!
'Tn all the jealous crowd, what she
'Why can’t the devil take you now?’ ”
'^'^Tell me your dream,” all breathlessly
'^And happiness, before it glided

(A bias worthy of our praise).
(A friendly glass, and friendly chatter
(A shrewd command that perfectly 
(Alas, too salty), and observing

A 'wealthy yonth and handsome too;
A Grandison attached to cards,
A Kalmuck, spectacled and worn,
A Kantian, unspoiled and truthful,
A Moscow winter was the thing.
A Moslem in his paradise.
A Muscovite in Harold’s cloak,
A balalaika gives me pleasure,
A ballroom tyrant, tightly laced,
A barrier that is no more,
A beau, a sergeant of the Guards.
A bigot seem — a patriot —
A black reproach in every word.
A black-firocked monk, or if a hare
A bleeding roastbeef’s on the table.
A book, a walk where shadows flitted
A brace of pistols and two balls 
A brazen fellow, starched and proud.
A classicist in such a fray.
A clue to joys beyond all measure.
A clumsy goose, and thinks to put 
A comrade’s promising career,
A cosmopolitan — or what?
A cottage with two rowan trees,
A country house he next may see —
A creature arid, cold, and vain.
A cross, a question-mark, a word —
A crouching huntsman, ill -concealed, 
A crowd of nymphs around her — lo!
A cue rests on the table -top.
A danger to all lovely ladies,
A decent chap — ^like you and me?
A deep economist, indeed,
A delicate green down assuming.
A dinner that was rather festive.
A down-stuffed couch are all, I think.
A dream . . . Cousine^ do you recall 
A drop of pity, you^ll forebear 
A drop of the dark fragrant stream;
A dwarf, whose tail is quite a feature,
A faddist and a firebrand.
A fairy light about her playing,
A fairy tale that lasts the night,
A friend in need, as you will gather —
A frontier shattered by the war
A frosty slight; the heavens muster
A gambler who won all the stakes,
A garden river-girt, and lo!
A gay mazurka holds the crowd;
A gentle sandy slope will please,
A giddy fop, and cruel spleen
A gifted talker, he would chatter
A girl will more than once forego.
A glance at many a curious book.
A glum, and next a merry man;
A good landed proprietor,
A gossip, glutton, clown, and cheat,
A gravestone tells its mournful story.
A guest comes, an indifferent player;
A habit, Lensky.” ^"^Oh, but clearly,
A halcyon bucolic scene,
A haughty general after her.
A haughty skeleton, and that
A heart that had not felt a pang —
A holy secret, and a voice 
A horn rang out, as in a dream;
A horrid shout assails the walls
A housewife seems a perfect treasure!
A kindred soul, he held, was burning
A kitchen and a fence below.
A land imagination hallows:
A laugh would bring the pair together?
A letter heartfelt, artless, candid;
A lexicon of snobbery
A lily of the valley blowing
A lively horse, but not too restive,
A living picture, or a jest.
A loaf is proffered, coins are taken,
A lyre that bears a little dove;
A man of rank, his worthy father
A man of sense, I am conceding,
A merry tune that, all unwilling,
A mighty music down the ages.
A mirror on the moon, now waning;
A missive eloquent of passion.
A mob-cap and a dressing-gown.
A mocking demon stirs within me
A modern Regulus; at need 
A moment since, this heart was quickened 
A moment, and the pair once more
A monogram he found too mazy,
A more magnificent reward.
A namby-pamby, colorless
A nice old woman, plain but pleasant.
A night of magic, and a moon . . .
A nobler page, more fine and true,
A noise off in the servants’ quarters 
A noisy brood. Not without fighting.
A northern ball in all its glory,
A note of Lensky’s composition;
A novelty framed to divert him;
A pallid swarm, the patients pour:
A pampered boy, allured by pleasure.
A passing thought’s enduring trace
A pattern spread; and soon what yearning 
A pitch-sealed bottle they were serving 
A place for the old-fashioned splendor: 
A place is found for every guest
A pleasant notoriety?
A pledge of every loveliness.
A poem to her on the spot.
A poppy could not match your face.”
A portrait of none else but me,
A precious pledge! The man was guided
A prize that chanced to come his way:
A proper distance to allow,
A pure love’s innocent effusion;
A regimental band is coming!
A rival, or to catch him napping.
A row of dinners, dull and sure,
A rustic view that she found fetching,
A scholar in a yellow shawl!
A second, and a third he sends,
A serf-boy takes his dog out sleighing,
A series of fatiguing scenes.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
A shadow, or a wife, pursues
A shaggy bear! At Tanya’s cry
A shelf of books he’s been perusing.
A simple Russian family
A simple monument is placed.
A slender crescent riding high.
A smile, Onegin is appealing 
A snare to maids’ imaginations)
A snowball down the hill goes tumbling
A snowdrift stirs, it falls asunder:
A soldier’s, wins us friends at Court,
A soldier spouse and a campaign.
A song across the waters drifted;
A song he brings for Tanya’s pleasure.
A spider; here a red-capped skull 
A spirit brooking no dictation?
A starry host of choiring spheres 
A stroke of genius, nothing less.
A sudden gust of wind surprises
A summer in the country, racing 
A swarm of thoughts exempt from blame.
A sweet remembrance to ensure.
A tale of sentiment not new,
A talked-of novel, rather hazy,
A tavern tribune, chief of rakes.
A tedious season they await
A tender father, a good master.
A thing Albani might have done;
A thing the winter could not chain;
A thought in which he acquiesced.
A thought was born, and grew, unbidden;
A tomb, a temple vowed to love,
A torrent gray with foam is pouring;
A touch, and the sharp cliffs are beveled,
A trespasser may hope for pardon.
A tumult in the Russian heart!
A veritable poet, yonder.
A very pedant in the youth.
A veteran W'ho never fails
A village view she seemed to know,
A virgin of ripe years, accepts
A wanton sigh was not worth mention:
A way for her; he’s happy if 
A welcome; it was not surprising 
A white cap shows, all in a trice:
A wind -mill all alone is whirling.
A word to solace and to save me:
A worthy course of action finds: 
A wretched ghost, a foreign joke
A young girl’s ardor, clear of guile.
A youth, who on the snow seems dozing;
AND FROM THERE TO THE CAUCASUS:
AU jealous thoughts evaporated —
Abandoning his pleasant village.
About her early indiscretion . . .
About her older sister now.
About his Olga; it may be.
About its magic healing fountains,
About the hills and meadows lying.
About the past, what’s done and gone; 
About the self-same thing, this clacking 
About the table monsters sit!
About the weather, flax, and cattle . . .”
About this common rustic view;
About: a noisy laughing host . . . 
Above her spinning-wheel’s low rattle;
Above it all, the wild applause.
Above the chess-board they will sit.
Above the domes of Moscow, dazing 
Above this modest urn there hung 
Abruptly down the incline bounding,
Absorbed in bitter meditation
Absorbed the girl, and she was thrown 
Accomplished as a vile coquette!
Accomplished in the end. Three cheers!
Across in safety to the path;
Across the meadowland alone,
Across the pane a shadow edges:
Admired — ^in sketching whom you blunted 
Admires alone Terpsichore 
Admiring glory, loving freedom,
Afar: the serpent and the tree 
Affairs of state, and over there 
Affected a most nasal '^'n”;
Affection’s pledge, indeed, expressing
Affection^ s spark in you^ believing 
Afraid before the headsman’s axe.
Afraid to stop: the bear is near;
African origin. His great-grandfather, Abram Petro- 
After an evening’s dissipations
After they’ve quarreled once again;
After this imexpected meeting,
Again a book was his sole crony —
Again her pale face looms before him,
Again imagination’s kindled.
Again, you’ll meet her, ’pon my life!”
Against a door, remarks with meaning 
Against the palm that holds it tight: 
Age comes to all, my darling, duly.
Aghast at time’s swift slipping sands.
Aghast, Tatyana recognized
Ah, dreams! where has your sweetness vanished?
Ah, friends, how I rejoiced, beholding
Ah, little feet, how I did love them!
Ah, my poor Lensky, he was made 
Ah, once how fast my heart would beat
Ah, spring, fair spring, the lovers’ season,
Ah, whither, whither did you flee?
Ah, yes, I knew such old wives’ tales,
Ah, yes, at some far distant date,
Ah, you are lovely, shores of Tauris,
Ail this is futile, and you know it,
Aind in a letter to a j&riend
Alas! by God’s strange will we must 
Alas! by a friend’s hand was slain.
Alas! the altar-fire is quenched.
Alas, it is not hard to guess!
Alas, our poor Onegin’s smitten:
Albani, an Italian painter of the seventeenth century, 
Albeit still a bachelor,
All’s hushed: within the parlor, sighing
All Eugene knew is past relating.
All candor and all grace in you.
All children know the melody:
All covered with the brittle snow;
All crowd into the drawing-room 
All day she roams the woods and mopes.”
All during the ensuing year.
All evening Lensky was distracted,
All greedy boredom’s progeny.
All greeted and congratulated
All hope is gone! He leaves, and curses
All hope, for aye, who enter here.”
All hustle, bustle, tell great lies,
All in good time, serene and thrifty —
All is foreseen: when I confess
All kin and kennels, crops and wine;
All labor, took to pensive ways; 
All life before us still lay fair.
All my past life has had one meaning —
All nonchalance and charm and grace,
All one might care to be or know;
All point to her, and all combine
All rise; he marches to the door.
All secrets safe. Tatyana sleeps.
All speaks of him, but to confound her;
All this is now outworn and faded,
All this lends charm to conversation.
All thoughts, but those of you, rejected.
All wish to see their daughters wed
All wonder whether they see rightly;
Allows a zest to oinr alarm.
Allured by neither looks nor station.
Ally or enemy, attend
Aloft, the whole of heaven sees;
Alone a lazy boatman lifted
Alone along the sea-shore; then
Alone among his new possessions,
Alone the shepherd, weak and hoary.
Alone, Tatyana broods, and soon
Alone, and sunk in calculation,
Alone? What of the eye-glass, eh?
Along dark streets wrapped deep in slumber
Along the forest path he crashes.
Already, ’neath the bridal crown.
Although I’ve glanced at, in times gone,
Although I find it so expressive.
Although he grew more melancholy,
Although her book has no pretensions
Although indeed I paid attention.
Although its touch be soft as fleece.
Although my freedom did not please me.
Although the house was empty, she 
Alw"ays together, now they’re sitting
Always the same and always novel.
Ambassador is speaking to?
Amid the snowdrifts, seething, roaring,
Amidst this dreary family,
Among her groves and meadows ranging.
Among sad chffs he moves. I’m fated
Among the crush of people passes,
Among the huts where Tartars dwell . . . 
Among the tents of nomads moving.
Among those regions drearily.
Amusement while you mix his potion;
An album verse with tender mien;
An alien, roving unrestricted,
An ancient, with perfumed gray hair, 
An ardent faith in liberty.
An eiffort to converse with her.
An escort much, puffed out his chest 
An exquisite both bold and natty.
An honest fellow, be it noted.”
An idle, cheerless recluse, near
An insect in a flower sunk;
An ordered way of life, confessing 
An uhlan wooed her, not in vain;
Ancestral Eve, you find delightful 
Ancestral portraits in the gloom
And . . . could not. Now she spoke, inquiring
And /ar niente is my law.
And Dunya squeaks (would she were dumb!)
And Eugene, when he saw these sirs —
And Flyanov, somewhat ill, encumber
And Fontenelle, acute, eupeptic;
And Grandison, who leaves us sleeping.
And I’d be happy . . . more or less!
And I’ve completed Chapter One.
And I admit, in penitence,
And I am such. Was it naught better
And I can’t say the clique is wrong 
And I confess I am perplexed:
And I have learned how to be meek*
And I shall speak, if you allow,
And I was just thirteen years old.
And I, all discipline refusing,
And Kura’s and Ajragva’s banks
And Lensky — Tanya; Kharlikova,
And Lensky, firm and unafraid.
And Lensky, grieving honestly,
And Lethe’s sluggish tide will swallow
And Lucifer’s hailed by the cock;
And Olenka’s. Why say them nay?”
And Russians too he would peruse:
And Strasbourg pies, imperishable;
And Tanya’s heart began to glow.
And Tanya enters. Here her prince.
And Tanya found the journey bleak.
And Turkish pipes of amber rare,
And a shy maiden’s pure caress.
And ail would relish the report
And all distraction finds her jaded,
And all exclaim delightedly
And all seemed dull. But soon the reading
And all she looked on glistened white.
And all that Paris in her passion
And all that sparkles, triumphs, sings.
And all their w’ayward stirrings cease, 
And all, our tender dreamer fused 
And also our calm hours of leisure.
And always needing some correction,
And an eternal friendship plighted
And an old gentleman espied her,
And answer with the barest greeting.
And ardently this Muse of mine
And as a child she’d romp and play
And as a rural miss appears
And as he reads, both thought and feeling
And as he says farewell again 
And as it hisses, gently steaming.
And as on these his fancy dwelt,
And as she looked about, dejected, 
And as she reads, the tears will rise
And at the following sweet session
And at the stations lice and roaches
And at the tavern-door the clack
And at the window, not too grim.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And been a faithful wife and mother.
And behaved well, you will agree;
And bids his servant, since time presses,
And bids us cast away the wreath 
And blessed the darkness bringing rest.
And blessed the man who rids him of 
And blesses, as he halts his clamor,
And blissful still, since all unknowing,
And boasted, bold beyond all measure. 
And boasts the freedom of the wings,
And both, though young, could but await
And breathe the free air of the stage,
And brooklets murmured pleasantly, 
And brushes, thirty shapes and sizes.
And by the way, now that I mention
And by this shaking bridge affrighted,
And by those ashes, mourning truly,
And can you not forgive, if she
And carried to that region where
And caught that foot in these two hands;
And certain pages (fabrications,
And chats of this and that politely;
And chequered brown and gold and green, 
And cleverly convey a note.
And clinch the point with a quotation.
And closed his turbulent career 
And covering a yawn with laughter —
And coveting the fatal food;
And craved the forest’s shady boon.
And credit the world’s fair appearance; 
And crossed the girl, and as she made 
And crosses black with flocks of daws.
And cruel traitresses who smile.
And curls as black as they were long.
And curses their unwelcome leisure;
And damask of the drawing-room —
And dashes off. Before the morrow
And dashes uphill and is gone;
And day will brighten wold and wave,
And did his shade in sorrow yearn?
And does his somber aspect mean 
And does not cease to pine and fret.
And does not pay the least attention.
And doing with her as he will.
And doings, in a friendly fashion?
And dream about his native land.
And dreaming of his exultation
And dreams and musings far from gay.
And drink desire’s sweet poisoned potion.
And drop in stars upon the shore.
And drops. His clouded eyes betray
And drunken stamp of the trepak,
And earn me fame and sound and fury.
And empty — so it seems to us . . .
And entered. Here the throng is trooping; 
And enters softly without rapping,
And enters the deserted court.
And epigrams that scored a hit.
And every query, every tale,
And everywhere that you may turn
And far too wretched to be meek
And fashion, or a parody?
And faster, faster throbs her heart.
And fawn and play the hypocrite.
And feelings, long quiescent, stirred;
And feigned the pang of jealousy,
And find, wherever she may sally
And fled afar . . . She followed me.
And fleeing, breaks the lilac-bushes,
And for his mind, his rank does duty.
And for the pranks he liked to play
And for the simple churchyard, telling
And forthwith to a ball he flew.
And found a partner in another.
And found his comments sane and smart.
And found it rather hard to spell;
And found their prudent talk vexation;
And freighted with a youthful gloom 
And friendly husbands’ heavy cheer?
And friendship’s claims he was refusing.
And fright but bred fidelity;
And from the servants’ anxious eyes.
And gains the brookside, breathing fast.
And gave his neighbor’s ribs a dig.
And girls who kiss with laughs and hugs,
And glance, unwilling, in the glass.
And glances at the door by stealth.
And golden autumn is arriving.
And gorges seven days a week.
And gratefully to bed they creep; 
And grief changed to serenity.
And grow, with time, intelligent.
And guard your daughters more severely.
And guards in silence all the while
And gulp them down as they arrive,
And had grown ashen-cold and surly;
And had his last farewells to say.
And had no word for him but blame —
And halts in sudden deep confusion;
And hand meets hand, and hearts beat high; 
And hands him linen white as snow.
And hard and cold, and petrify 
And has she found the word? She lets
And having noted, in a pet.
And having stared through my lorgnette
And he had set her heart awhirl!
And he was busy anyway.
And he was not the least elated 
And he will throw you in a trice.
And he would have a deal to say . . .
And he, reluctant to surrender,
And health and hope and joy are banished:
And healthless look, his dumb remorse — 
And hear, above the lake, their cries,
And heedless of the winter fun.
And her head sinks. The dawn grows bolder, 
And here hussars on leave, resplendent
And here too was [Prolasov], stunted
And his brief look of tenderness —
And his cheek pale, she does not see 
And his the charm of simple art.
And holding him in such affection
And hotter yet the blush is glowing
And how it strikes me, never mind).
And hurriedly before it perished
And if her soul was deeply stirred,
And if that’s not enough to do,
And if the sudden sight dismayed her.
And in a voice pohte but reedy
And in an attitude confiding,
And in due time the husband passed 
And in exchange he took as well
And in her mind a billet-doux
And in her soul was resurrected
And in high London circles, they 
And in our names (and in our verses);
And in that far and savage spot
And in the court gay magpies screamed;
And in the crowd that filled the hovel,
And in the grave his bones have rest!”
And in the mist her little finger
And in the misty moonlight furled.
And in the sleigh most carefully
And integers: ourselves alone.
And into the deep forest plunges;
And is the vernal crown of youth 
And it is %^ery hard to bear
And it is precious, being brief:
And it is weighted down with snow;
And its cold white magnificence:
And its late sequel as absurd.
And ivory balls, not more than two.
And jealous in a frigid way.
And jealous longing frets the maid —
And kept him underneath her rule.
And know that heart will never quicken?
And lands remote, where on the breast
And lean upon it with assurance . . .
And leave the forests gaunt and harsh.
And leaves the little hovel shaking , . . 
And let his tears unheeded shower;
And lifts his hand as who defies
And lightly clad, though airs were chill,
And likes the pallid evening light
And likewise do not find beguiling
And lives like a true sage at last,
And locked him in a corner where
And longing thus, be forced to meet you
And looks, and calls him . . . But no power
And love’s delicious dream, and, too,
And love is but the devil’s tool.
And loved the duties well fulfilled.
And many a solemn protestation 
And mists above the meadows brooded;
And modern man’s true soul divulging:
And more play whist, whose fame’s enduring —
And mortgaged all the land he owned.
And most, the linden-shaded ways
And murmur sing-song confidences,
And my Zaretzky, as I said,
And my heart whispered: it is he!
And my own man I want to be.
And near a stream, stood calm and proud, 
And neighbor wheezes unto neighbor.
And never after that went near it.
And never loved where it desired,
And never said his passions nay.
And next he dressed . . .
And next the girl’s guitar we see;
And night would find her far from sleep. 
And nightmares and hallucinations.
And no calumnious friend so pert
And none can hear his neighbor speak.
And not a single w^ord deleted;
And not a station will be known
And not long years of separation,
And not without a tell-tale blush.
And notes complexions, with a sneer
And nothing to remark or pardon;
And now Zaretzky measures off
And now for the first time I’m bringing
And now she leaps and claps her heels.
And now the guests, exchanging glances.
And now they bring out eighteen jades.
And now what of Onegin? Truly
And now, at spring’s bright invitation.
And now, since I’ve no more to tell,
And nowhere is a spot of ink.
And nurses scream and children roar.
And of repeating platitudes,
And of the glorious days of old,
And offer hospitality.
And oh, they are a weary weight!
And old companions, dull and vicious;
And on Caucasian cliffs how often.
And on her lips a careless smile.
And on her shoulder leans his head;
And on the last page this reflection:
And on the lovage dropped a tear.
And on their skates the merry boys
And once I gave my meager all
And one fibne morning finds him flying
And one may find a mirror lying
And one thing more put us asunder —
And one would find the children roaming
And other cares, severe, distressing,
And out of an old-fashioned notion
And pen; good night.” Her single taper
And people later, with a frown,
And pity took the place of anger.
And plait his humble footgear there.
And pleading first that by-and-by
And pleasant though it is to roam.
And plunged in sorry thought, more slowly
And ponder each move’s secret meaning.
And praise Odessa’s gardens greatly.
And presses her soft hand — elation
And pride that ever looks askance.
And prim young misses looking sage;
And promised them each year again
And prompts something satirical;
And purr the while: Tatyana saw
And puts her little hand at length 
And quite as faithless as their feet.
And raise love’s value cleverly;
And raised his nose above the rest.
And raises fowls, while at his knee
And rash the question that she broaches:
And re-upholstered for the trip.
And resolute, she shipped the peasant
And rightly, but his pain was such
And rightly: for Onegin, sitting
And roam the sea’s expanse, unpent.
And roamed its gardens at my ease,
And rootless dreams that could not last,
And round the loaded carriage crowded,
And sadly, virginally sighing,
And scrapes his chair along the floor;
And search my nonsense for some wit.
And seat the two friends hastily.
And seemed about to faint and fall;
And sees the gaping fiends of hell:
And send them, armed, from Led at dawn,
And sentimentally devoted
And sentinel to sentinel 
And served each course to them by rank.
And setting up a new regime;
And shall return to him, I vow,
And sharing leisure, thoughts, and food,
And she — she who for Tanya posed . . . 
And she will learn my knowledge of
And she, not knowing men are heartless,
And show commercial enterprise.
And shrewdly held his peace; in sport
And shun the heart that would be tender.
And silently recall the past?
And silhouetted by the beams,
And sings, off key. The song is greeted
And sinks from sight, soon to be crumbling. 
And sleep at last her boon conferred;
And sleighing, and, when light grew dimmer,
And slept beside her every night.
And smoothly glide on polished boards; 
And snoring, heavy Pustyakov 
And so God grant them health and cheer!
And so all hail to you, nine Muses, etc.”
And so for days poor Tanya broods.
And so from idle talk she flies.
And so he’ll rifle keener minds;
And so her quick imagination
And so inflexible their virtue.
And so of course the girl decided
And so the bumptious guild denies him;
And so the guests would say good-bye.
And so the morrow passes, too —
And so they aged, like all things mortal,
And so was captured by the French —
And so without more words, departed;
And so, my home was then Odessa . . .
And solitude — this was, in fine,
And some harsh judges found, forsooth,
And sometimes in my heart I own
And sometimes neatly made retort.
And soon the east will be alight;
And soon their tongues begin to race.
And sooth, I fled these haughty belles 
And stares unseeing, in no hurry
And staring in dismayed surprise,
And started on his aimless cruising.
And steamed herself on Saturday —
And steps across; her Mood congeals;
And still our Eugene lies abed
And stop defenceless in the field.
And strolling with the throng you’ll view
And such a crowd, a perfect rabble . .
And suddenly he’s at the gate.
And sulked, and swore that he would trim
And swift to flee from fun and folly,
And talk that brighten’s friendship’s ways.
And tears of reconciliation
And tedious planned holidays.
And tells her doll with anxious thought
And terror-stricken would await
And that between her teeth, to greet 
And that for many a long day.
And that it cheated us again;
And the cool yawns that come amain. 
And the deep seas His praise rehearse
And the fond fool would then pursue
And the grave eyes that have undone me
And the improvement will be splendid! 
And the long evenings black as ink.
And the opinion of the town . . .
And the polite world’s hurly-burly.
And the poor girl is roused betimes
And the rare magic of the Muse
And the same pom, and the same spouse, 
And the smooth waters, mirror-bright,
And the two friends for death competing, 
And the word’s new — should not be great.
And the world smiled upon her, pressing
And the young city miss who’s facing
And then appeared a row of glasses.
And then at home all day he stays
And then once more till noon sleep sound.
And then sat silent for the nonce.
And then the wayward course of passion. 
And then, refreshed after a dipping,
And then, with Olga, how he acted!
And there’s a witch with a goatee,
And there a traveler from a distance,
And there beside the rocky shallows
And there he also wrote another
And there she stayed, and wept, and wept.
And there the weary ploughmen dally.
And there were those who said they knew
And they delight to see it flow.
And thin, but pretty, more or less;
And think of it! So timid is he,
And this routine was to his taste.
And those I do not greatly me;
And though he was an ardent rake,
And though the talk of my yotmg friend
And thought he met with no rebuff.
And thought, I do not doubt, of me.
And through the frosty window-pane
And throws this challenge in our teeth:
And thunderous, flock eagerly:
And thus reduce him to confusion;
And time would pass, and there would be
And to a humble cottage dashes:
And to his stand the cabby goes.
And to my lips the words came thronging;
And to put finis to their chatter;
And to the final pages turning.
And took his medal for a toy
And treading toes, between the chairs 
And trifles of importance to
And truffles, luxury of youth,
And trusted her with house and pelf,
And tucked away, an almanac
And tunnels under water, too.
And turn the meadow to a marsh 
And turned a joyful face to greet him
And turns to what is hers no more:
And vainer labor there is none —
And valleys, trees, and hamlets seemed 
And virtue won its due reward.
And visit at the Christmas season,
And w^ept his father and his mother . . .
And w^ho could wield the poet’s pen. 
And wake the birds in beech and larch.
And walk him in the afternoon.
And was at Olga’s ere he knew it!
And watch her, languidly enchanted!
And watch life’s furrows briefly nourish
And watch the failing of his breath,
And wdth a heart for love designed,
And what a throat! And what a spirit! . . .
And what of my Onegin? Drowsing,
And what the fashions were that fall.
And what the moon might signify.
And what was my amazement, finding
And when a star dropped down the sky
And when consoled by art — and fame,
And when the little girls collected
And when their wives talked, it was worse.
And when they entered, arm in arm,
And when we find our old devotion 
And when, at midnight, madcap Russians,
And when, besides, her heart was wrung:
And where he left a lasting trace.
And where indeed of her they’re prating.
And where one falls, another surges . . .
And where the faithful suitor hovers,
And where the youthful galaxy
And where two pines their shadows fling
And while a husband is respected
And while my wanton muse rejoices
And while the breakfast is preparing
And while the world in silence slept.
And while they all are in high feather,
And whispering, make quite a stir:
And whom shall we confide in, pray?
And whom we kiss as they expect,
And why? What am I striving for?
And will accustom us to grammar;
And window -sashes rattled loudly.
And with a cheerful eye to greet you ! —
And with a somber splendor shone
And with enamored eyes to see
And with good cheer and merry sally
And with love’s sw^eet confusion dizzy,
And with my vanished spring, it seems,
And with strange languor fill my blood!
And with the malice time imposes.
And with the spark of a bon mot
And without foolish affectation.
And wore — her last defences down —
And wore the funeral wTeath at last.
And worn in comfort, far from town.
And yet Odessa, our wet city,
And yet her face was pale and clouded
And yet her trust he’d not belie,
And yet more pleasant, on the sly
And yet she found it no affliction —
And yet the auguries perplex her.
And yet win luster from my writing;
And yet, were morals not in question,
And you shall judge me as you may.
And you, bright phantoms round him thronging,
And you, can you remain the same?
And you, my dear, are doomed to perish;
And you, my fair ideal, too,
And you, my reader, wise and witty.
And you, oh, youthful inspiration,
And you, skilled pupils of Levshin,
And young in youth; blessed is he 
And your remarkable collection
And, careless of the cold, is training
And, feeling they had done their best,
And, fortune’s darling, in his rhyming
And, if my novel is to thrive.
And, seated, eagerly is eyeing
And, there at home, for Russia sigh.
And, with no aim on which to fix,
Anew the garrulous fond lyre?
Angel or fiend, as you prefer.
Anisya surely won’t ignore them;
Anna’s reign, Annibal, who had incurred Biihren’s 
Annibal’s curious life is known only from stories pre- 
Announce the coming of his bales.
Announces it is dinner-time.
Another’s amorous invention
Another’s grief is hers to rue,
Another’s joy her heart possesses. 
Another’s, and his memory 
Another ! . . . No, I could have given
Another day without an aim;
Another day: he still is dumb;
Another demon seizing me,
Another landowner come newly
Another neighbor tapped his skull:
Another set of lines transpired 
Another, at a god’s dictation.
Anticipating this distraction.
Apart, Tatyana can but linger
Aplomb, he lifts his eye-glass, stares
Appeal, complaint, confession, sobbing 
Appears, his broom in hand, still blinking;
Approach!” How calm and cold their faces.
Approached her pillow, she would raise 
Archives of the Foreign Office.
Are all but flowing; her heart flutters,
Are all your relatives quite w ell?
Are certain that it only means 
Are charming, friends, but I would put
Are cordial to the country cousins.
Are crammed with all that’s necessary:
Are dazzling, and rejoice our hearts.
Are far too pleasant to seem long.
Are found absurd or else offensive 
Are glad at last to take a rest:
Are guarding fur-coats faithfully;
Are here cast off, or so the flighty 
Are here, with scissors straight and curved. 
Are in them, and the sparkle of 
Are just the same as what they were; 
Are lulled to sleep, and readily 
Are quite forgot- The path is now 
Are quite perplexed by such as she:
Are roaring the recitative.
Are settled: they are fast asleep;
Are such a man would rather bleed
Are turned by one cool glance to ice,
Are waltzing round the dancing-floor.
Are you a guardian angel to me?
Armenian, Spaniard, Frenchman, Greek,
Aroused your pity then . . . You’re kneeling 
As Eugene stares his heart is chilled
As Eugene, by regrets distracted.
As I am, too, a little rest:
As I fared onward gloomily,
As I her rustic charms survey.
As Lensky’s life that knew no guile,
As a fit sequel to the roast:
As a good comrade, one who shares 
As at a mighty funeral feast;
As custom bade; with charm and spell 
As did the bard — yet not aquiver
As did this author: chief of all 
As do the sins of years long fled 
As does proud Moscow, in its rights.
As erstwhile comes, to hum an air
As every spring the sapHngs show
As fancy in the lot would trace 
As fields are blest by storms of spring:
As grateful as a kiss, as simple
As he comes near; it’s no illusion:
As he depicted their delights;
As he was followed by the blues.
As her good nurse w^ould have her do:
As hermits live who hope for heaven
As his repellent aid he proffers;
As in a nightmare each one aims
As infant slumbers, as the moon
As many wiles as I could mention 
As men need air, they found kvass needful,
As my confession. Why say more?
As on a shaky bench he lays her.
As on another road I fare.
As one who fought forgotten wars
As one who through a fog is peering,
As only passion can have wrought.
As perfect as an illustration —
As rock and wave, or ice and flame.
As she says gently: ^^Rise; have done.
As she surveyed him . . . His dejected 
As some time later to assert
As suddenly grew timorous,
As that of one beneath a spell.
As the dark coverts were denuded;
As the two foes, with even tread.
As though a chiQy hand were laid
As though he’s surely done with books.
As though she feared an inquisition
As though there were a tacit ban
As through the dust his horses fare.
As upon any other day.
As well as write; and how he bowed!
As wild as they: forsook her songs 
As years went by, and readily
As you discover life’s allures,
As, my Onegin, I drop you.
As, sped like arrows from the bow.
Ashamed to own his every feature;
Ashore at last, and our endeavor 
Aside all timid thoughts, forgetting 
Askance at fair, unwonted faces,
Asked what Onegin’s visit meant,
Asked who she was, set straight his wig,
Asleep j&rom boredom?” "Not at all.”
At Carnival in savory cheer,
At Christmas, carols were their pleasure;
At Europe’s dainty handicraft,
At Whitsun, when the populace
At a soiree. '^God! to see her! . . .
At any gathering or dance,
At bottom, and, too bored to think.
At cards with his inheritance!
At dawn tomorrow, near the mill;
At dawn, by Cytherea’s light.
At dusk a sleigh’s the thing, and caMng:
At dusk the samovar is gleaming
At either end the two friends stand.
At everything she gazes on;
At fifteen feet: his aim was good.
At first Eugene began to dream
At first Madame controlled the child;
At first but wept and tore her hair.
At first disturbed me, in the end 
At giddy feasts and wild discussions,
At heart, giving a single jot.
At him . . . And if she was amazed,
At home his pistols claimed attention;
At last for whom her heart is yearning 
At last he rouses, opens wide
At last she rose, and gently sighing
At last, by night, arrived the snow*
At least of some complaint arthritic?
At least, if pity seemed to soften
At length our hollow-hearted hero
At mere epistolary prose.
At noisy gatherings and after.
At once he offered with a smirk
At once that guests might be expected.
At once the slanderer to defy.
At once, and bear the weapon -case.
At peace, it is my artless pleasure
At slaughter, with a heart of leather . . .
At table, ’neath the damask cover.
At that she could no longer hide
At the age of eighteen Annibal was sent by the
At the back porch in readiness,
At the casino cosily;
At the commencement of my story
At the gay spectacle turned hollow. 
At the sad turning of the years,
At the spinet, then swiftly quitting 
At thirty profitably wed.
At this unlucky moment, we
At times she pays him no attention;
At twenty to the fashion bred,
At whiles, upon their elbow's leaning,
Aunt Pelageya still possesses
Ausonia’s happy sons are trilling 
Avails to rouse him: he is gone.
Away already: without fail.
Away forever, was so near! . . . 
Away with Olga, nothing loth;
Away, his profile may be seen ...”
Away, the good old sleigh, at last. 
Away, while the old sleigh was mended 
Awhile all conversation ceases;
Ay is risky, if delicious;
Ay, when, foaming gold, it hisses . . .
BARATYNSKY
BE THOU SPARED THESE FEARFUL DREAMS,
BYRON
Bakhchi-Sarai.”
Bare steppe is all you will behold;
Baroness Barbara von Kriidener; St. Preux and Wol- 
Bassoon and flute at once are heard.
Bat have one things when you were gone^
Be fact, and can my spring be past 
Be patient, then, as with a brother:
Be quick! Drive on!” he bids the peasant;
Be ruled by what is small and mean?
Be sentenced by a crooked jury 
Be she? It is . . . But no . . . And yet . . .
Be sure you have your grandson go.”
Be thou my staffs nor let me stray.
Be thrilled upon Elysian ways 
Bearing her jar o’er creaking snows;
Bears the proud burden of her rank!
Because he could make no bon mot.
Because he hated litigation
Because it’s long since I have sinned.
Because my husband’s decoration,
Because rash ardor and quick wit
Because society’s conventions,
Because the tune is so diverting,
Because there are no words in Russian
Because there was not much to pay,
Because they lacked — hadn’t one heard? — 
Because your honor and your pride 
Because, between the lines before him. 
Been married long?” ^’Two years.” whom?”
Befits and pleases you and me?”
Before a storm; I wanted, too,
Before her charge, whose eyes were full.
Before her door; he waits for her;
Before her now, without a doubt:
Before him, loud with seething trajfl&c,
Before it’s heard, is grave and quiet.
Before the altar, head cast down.
Before the threshing-floor, thick willows 
Before they halted at a gateway 
Before whom my bold lyre is muted,
Before, her bow was as serene.
Begged that her husband sniffer her
Begins to raise his pistol coolly.
Beheld the bed where all must lie,
Behind a hill the moon is hidden;
Behind a stump among the trees
Behind the curtain’s funeral fold
Behind the mill they went straightway.
Behind the strange bed’s silken curtain
Behold each generation flourish,
Behold the Russian tents in ranks.
Behold! from town arrives — what rapture!
Beholding Lensky. ^^Well?” Forthrightly
Beholding bareness everywhere.
Belong to youth, with youth are fled.
Beloved ... or such was his conviction,
Below that other’s signature
Below you see the river wind
Below, though it is early yet,
Beneath her pillow, empty playthings;
Beneath her pillow. Darkness keeps 
Beneath his fingers would have hurled 
Beneath it: d. v. Annette”;
Beneath my Afric’s sunny sky,
Beneath the Finnish sky, alone.
Beneath the light of stars and lamps.
Beneath the prudent flag of peace.
Beneath the shade of his acacias
Beneath their sky he plucked his lyre,
Beshtau, the sharp-peaked, the eternal
Beside a stream, or on a hill.
Beside his heavy mate is lying.
Beside his wife, that chubby charmer.
Beside my quiet lake, beset 
Beside that most superb of creatures,
Beside that stream with shadows laced
Beside the fire a table’s set.
Beside the fire and hum to it 
Beside the stanza all unfinished
Beside the window. So life passes . . .
Beside the window; on the pane 
Best leeches send him to the spas.
Betrayed — he took a welcome rest. 
Betrayed no anger, no surprise 
Betrays my stomach, and although 
Between a rascal and a bore;
Between her hours of toil and leisure
Between two aunts, beside a post,
Bewildering the wretched man.
Beyond the grave, yes, at the end 
Beyond, the Caucasus’ tall masses,
Beyond, the plain, with hamlets dotted,
Birch, linden, aspen, all are bare;
Black chasm were gaping at her feet . . . 
Blase, growm tired of empty leisure.
Bleak tete-a-t^te concludes; he cheers 
Blessed is he who could be merry
Blessed is he who leaves the glory 
Blessed the new master every day.
Bloomed like a flower in the shade;
Bore to the grave to sleep forever 
Born of a liar in an attic.
Both carriages and people flounder.
Both friends and foes (they’re ail the same).
Both love and malice scarce recalling, 
Both tongue and seal are pink, are dry.
Bottles of cellar-cooled light wine:
Bowed lower, sought to catch her eye;
Breathes through the words she is inditing.
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Briefly surveying every tier.
Bucolic piece! Good Lord, have pity!
Built by the fishermen was flaring.
Bumps down Tverskaya Street already.
But Eugene’s sole preoccupation
But Eugene, now his friend was gone, 
But I’m a dunce! They bade me say
But I became another’s wife;
But I foresee a fresh objection.
But I grow old, and memory fails;
But I salute hope’s shy intrusion,
But I, my friend, am not contending
But Tanya’s mother, not ignoring
But Tanya does not share our pleasure.
But Tanya had no tears at all;
But Tanya, dreaming, hardly hears,
But Tasso’s murmured octaves are,
But all too soon the summer ends.
But are those stirrups he is hearing?
But as for me . . . my loving praise
But as the rural dusk advances
But at eighteen that is the rule;
But at her window, fain to weep.
But at the late and sterile season,
But bears refreshment and renewal —
But brings to mind our fading years 
But business holds the greater part.
But by rule only, and he doted
But by some influence despotic.
But by the window she would brood
But by your will; my fate* s decided;
But curious, as maidens are,
But dinner’s served, and arm in arm
But drops it without more ado.
But ere ’tis open, fades and crumbles.”
But even then, and more’s the pity,
But ever sadder, ever fonder.
But fast or slow, leave town behind!
But fiery youth cannot dissemble
But find the North is not my style.
But first he answers: ’’Agafon.”
But first, what dark delight you cherish, 
But for my part I do not mind
But for my wretched fate preserving
But for one thing he had a bent,
But for that sermon do not think
But from the ones we love and trust,
But have a warm, frank welcome for you.
But he refuses; he’s preparing
But he will back you while you live,
But heedlessly; she cannot school
But her good husband loved her dearly,
But her soul aches, and nothing pleases.
But here’s our lady unattended.
But here is tea: the girls demurely
But his grave illness, I confess,
But hush! Our sternest critic rises
But in a corner who is standing,
But in my youth no one engaged 
But in parenthesis I mention:
But in their praises why be stringing
But it is late, he should be leaving;
But it was not capitulation
But journeys made in wintry weather
But just to tease your appetite;
But keep to their familiar ways:
But knew the most amusing stories
But left alone, Onegin sighed.
But left him bored to a degree,
But let us rather now inquire
But like a shadow moves about,
But listens with an absent smile.
But lo! from out the morning valley
But love grew greater, unreqmted;
But naught avails her girlish wrath;
But never mind the turn you gave me;
But never mind, let’s rather hurry
But no! — straight down the steps to meet him
But no! the whole thing came to naught.”
But no, our paths have separated.
But none as yet came near divining
But nothing hurts when you are playing;
But nothing offers consolation.
But now . . . the tombstone and its story
But now I am fed up with it;
But now a kind and simple father,
But now adieu, oh, golden playtime!
But now all minds are fogged and cloudy,
But now her reason and her will 
But now it’s time for the ballet.
But now the blue of evening darkens.
But now the heavy hammer’s pounding
But now, ’tis as a house forsaken.
But now, enough, have done; for you
But now, the prey of evil passion,
But oh, how deeply we must rue it.
But other fancies, dark and chill.
But our Onegin’s heart was stricken
But our Onegin’s out of range
But reasonable conversation.
But scarce did consciousness forsake him
But seeing Olga wouldn’t read ’em.
But she had heard of them a dozen
But she in whom my thoughts are rooted.
But she prepared a conflagration.
But she took fright, our shy Tatyana;
But she was slow of wit at best.
But silent as a sage he sat
But somehow his mere look averred
But soon was yawning while he raced:
But spend three hours before the glass,
But stepping forth she slips and tumbles;
But still she pants, her terror growing.
But tenderness his look did show.
But that is not my pleasure now.
But that the wedding was deferred
But the discussions I have heard, 
But the proud princess, cold and serious,
But the provincial town affords 
But the sad ruin brought no sigh
But then he never read a page.
But then he paused, and with his narrow
But then, it puts me to the test.
But there’s no need that I dissemble
But there’s no rule that has not any:
But they demand a madrigal!
But this bright sibilant potation
But this gay circle I deserted.
But those good friends who were insistent
But though Onegin’s peace forsake him
But though the arguments are keen,
But tiresome ghosts. Can we unmask him? 
But to endure I need one boon —
But to the garden let us race
But was true joy to Eugene granted 
But what availed her urgent passion?
But what w^as further to transpire 
But when he comes they notify him
But where Melpomene’s bold gesture
But where is my disjointed story?
But where no more one meets his face . . .
But whither in such anxious haste
But who does that is only choosing
But wishes them away with speed.
But with a new interpretation,
But with the living truth aglow,
But worldly quarrels breed the dread
But worse, what now you choose to do!
But wretched is the man who never
But years went rolling by, and then
But yet the pleasure’s dulled if he
But yielding to a dream’s distraction,
But you’re already dressed! God save me.
But you, Bordeaux, I always treasure
But you, chance volumes that in Hades
But, God, such boredom who would sample? —
But, Lord, before the evening’s ended 
But, Muse, you must forget the past.
But, every interruption spurning,
But, feeling the blind archer’s sting,
But, gentlemen, you may decline
But, heavens, what am I to do
But, lacking them, the joy’s diminished;
But, like a man of worth and sense,
But, rain or shine, each day his coach is
Buyanov’s hand she has refused,
Buyanov leads off Pustyakova;
By Fate’s imperious decree.
By God! I wish I could retract.
By Lensky and his love; light flashes;
By a dark hope of what might be.
By a most happy whim. Lord Byron
By a slim icicle united.
By a sly dodge or ready jape.
By a translated move or word,
By afternoon he will be waking.
By an assumed austerity;
By any wife who’s virtuous.
By candle-light she rose and dressed.
By chance, these verses have not perished;
By dinner, tea, and supper merely.
By dreams of a far country shaken.
By facile conquest swiftly tired.
By grandmammas and grandpapas.
By grove and stream and field and steep — 
By hate and dread, and strongly beat 
By her dull partner’s mood infected;
By honor’s dictates, was indeed 
By ladies in society . . .
By longing. I am ill, I fear:
By mental effort tranquilizing
By mocking glance or chilly word,
By new desires I am enchanted.
By night, in dalliance, sweeter far.
By nothing stirred, where all is dim.
By now the wine of poesy
By one emotion only stirred;
By one persistent thought he’s haunted.
By poetry and love, or sickened 
By solitude nowise dejected;
By some obscure presentiment.
By someone awkward and afraid.
By sullen time, and soon grow wry 
By thaw and grimy steps defaced.
By the Neva it may be you
By the still stream, with dusk descending.
By the young Olga’s winning ways,
By this delightful counsel guided,
By this most black and vengeful mood? 
By those whose parts are not extensive?
By tiresome rhymes and vain regret,
By too-sweet tea, the ladies’ meekness, 
By what Tolstoy’s fine brush created.
By what is his cold torpid soul
By words and looks insidious
By worldly approbation paid.
By your good friend, all without guile,
Calash^ kibitka, crowded sleigh.
Call it magnetic or hypnotic.
Can a man do? Go walking there?
Can be surprised, who is not stirred 
Can it be Eugene? Truly? . . . Aye!
Can it be she who only now
Can it be that Tatyana truly
Can only curse his wedding-day!
Can shovel silver with a spade;
Can the sad thought with which I flirted
Can this be she who long since wrote —
Can you, so generous, so keen.
Cannot eclipse her neighbor’s quite.
Careless of others’ joy and pain.
Caressed the tomb o’er which it swung.
Caressingly repaid your song?
Caricaturing every guest.
Carry this letter secretly
Catch the first stirrings of the heart.
Catherine’s reign at the age of ninety-two.
Caught fast, she cannot get away.
Ceased, like all else, to be amusing.

Cherries and red raspberries.
Close as a marmot would require —
Cold ashes hide no smoldering ember;
Come away, girls, come away!
Come here, my dear. Why, this seems all
Come home again, young Lensky duly
Come seek the stream that slowly goes 
Come to eternal rest, lies here.”
Come warm yourself where it is cozy;” 
Come, it is time to dine once more.
Come, rouse anew imagination —
Comes up to carry Olga off.
Commands your tender minstrelsy?
Commemorating one who’s gone;
Compelled young boughs, in sultry heat,
Complaint will make my pain no less.
Confide to it the wish she cherished.
Confound the senses suddenly.
Congratulations! Now we are 
Consequently, either I have the girth of a fifteen- 
Consoled the lady quite completely.
Consumed with terror, Tanya, quaking,
Consumption yet may overtake him.
Content in my old age to follow
Content, since habit, more or less,
Converse at ease, seem to rejoice.
Coquette believes; the old man dreams 
Cottin.
Could Russia pardon my defection
Could alter Lensky’s virgin soul 
Could drain each morning bottles three.
Could hoodwink the inteUigent;
Could not conceive how pompous Grimm
Could not wash down with Veuve Cliquot
Could scarce inspire young Lensky’s zest.
Could scarcely count them, should I try.”
Could she but have foreseen the meeting 
Could show him an approximation 
Crossing the ballroom’s polished floor.
Crowding, the trees about it grow,
Custodian of the desert, fills
Cut off before his hopes could bloom;
Czar to France, where he began his service in the 
DMITRIYEV
Dared clean his nails in front of him —
Dark Melmoth fills her wuth delight;
Darkly it rushes on amain,
Dawn’s air is sweet, she does not feel it.
Daylong, nightlong, thus to be bid 
Dear Olga is his only matter.
Dear friend, before this heart is nmnb —
Dear reader, pardon the betrayal;
Dear reader, what you are about-
Deceit and gossip, rings and tears,
Deceit exists, but clings with tender 
Decipher epigraphs at sight.
Decked out as for a holocaust . . .
Deep drifted in the snowy hush.
Deep in the dust that time has laid.
Deep tenderness; perhaps he meant it.
Deep truths, or well-drawn scenes — yet not
Deferring to my wealth and rank.
Delight is mingled with distress
Delphine: the leading character in a novel of the same 
Described the town; we must admit.
Described with frenzied inspiration
Describes in pensive tracery 
Designed for you so sad a lot!
Desires that are too keen to slake.
Detractors, cowardly and vile,
Devoured Stendhal, the arrant skeptic.
Diana’s breast, the face of Flora,
Didelot enjoyed his victories
Dirk, door, eclipse, fir, ghost, ice, knave, 
Disdain sits silent in his eye; 
Dispatched his friend, and had his pleasure,
Displays her languor and her pride 
Displays to the indifferent crowed 
Disputing your small legacy.
Disturbed by ghosts of days gone by;
Diviners and Chaldean sages.
Djc !|e
Do I thus give you an excuse?
Do me this favor, nurse, I pray.”
Do not be cross because I fail
Do not spy upon our games.
Does Eugene drive? Yes, I suspected
Don’t aim to cover it with glory:
Donning Ms wide-br imm ed Bolivar,
Down to the waterfront there stumbles
Downhill she_trudges, scarcely breathing.
Drenched, deluged, choked with viscous mud;
Dressed early, shadow-pale, and sighing,
Drinks wine from tumblers,” it was hissed;
Drives home to take his night’s repose,
Drives home; and so at last to bed:
Drunk as an owl, into a trench.
Dub you a rogue, which is unfair.
Dufresny, 1654-1724.
During a drunken conversation
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
ELLE ETOIT FILLE, ELLE ETOIT AMOUREUSE.
EUGENE ONEGIN GOES
Each detail of our friend’s attire.
Each hour of torment added fuel
Each long and narrow as your waist,
Each man must do as he prefers —
Each morning I awake proposing
Each morning by the Moscow chimes,
Each room he finds unoccupied.
Each rural mother hopes to capture.
Each smile of yours, each glance, each motion;
Each to the other slyly winking,
Each whispers from behind her hand:
Each with a weapon in his hand.
Early editors substituted this name for the asterisks 
Eavesdroppers, be off, auxiyl
Education; he was a stickler for purity in language. 
Egypt’s retired corsair too.
Eh, friend?” But no, attend again:
Eight times changed places since they started; 
Eliminated belle Nina,
Emboldened by his Olga’s smile,
Emotion is for clowns and fools.
Enchanted her while yet a child,
Enchanting, sparkling, frivolous.
Enjoy staid domesticity,
Enlightenment makes such as we 
Enlightenment may be belated
Ennui pervading the haul monde.
Enough to kill a reputation.
Enough! My soul is calm and quiet
Enough, sing other tunes, move on!” 
Enough. ’Tis time that I presented
Enough. Though late, I’ve done my duty,
Entreaties, vows, and foolish fears.
Ere yet the crystal with precision
Esteemed emotion, feeling none.
Etcetera. The glosses vex her.

Eugene alone goes home to sleep.
Eugene alone was framed to measmre
Eugene berates them, rolls his eyes.
Eugene flings wide the door: defenseless.
Eugene had long abominated
Eugene himself with eyes that burned
Eugene perused the sad epistle;
Eugene should not have been so rash.
Eugene was apt at keeping still;
Eugene was not alone in noting
Eugene, as he his turn awaited.
Eugene, more tolerant than many.
Europe has spurious wines to offer;
Even Didelot becomes a bore.”
Even a man of honor: thus
Even by accident is heard 
Even the pistol and the sword.
Examine Tanya silently
Except the stomach; I may mention 
Exceptions may be hard to find,
Excerpts
Exhibiting the present age,
Expressing the discrimination,
Extolling you in tones of fire!
FARE THEE WELL, AND IF FOR EVER
FROM
FROM MOSCOW TO NIZHNI -NOVGOROD:
Fair Nina Voronskaya, who
Fair ladies who are sentimental —
Familiar hills, familiar alleys.
Far back to a lost spring, and we.
Farewell! Forever, or for years?”
Farewell, proud palace! But why wait?
Farewell, you friendly skies of home;
Fat merchants, Cossacks, boulevards,
Fate guarded Eugene, our young waster;
Fate had arranged it otherwise.
Fate plans a different conclusion . . .
Fear of censorship seems to have been a minor factor; 
Fed by his slipper or review.
Feeling and thought with music’s strain.
Fell at her feet, his heart contracted;
Fie finds suflScient occupation
Find life a function to endure.
Finding my youthful dream come true —
Fine ladies, military fops.
Fine tales about your fair young Finn.
First Eugene, still advancing duly.
First at the desk, with lamp unlighted.
First glory, and then wealth and rank.
First let us prick his vanity
First snow, and delicately wrote 
First, memory would trace the features,
First: he accused himself of mocking
Five centuries are all we need 
Flames up, the embers glow again 
Fling him currants ripe and red.
Flings wide the door; his caftan’s torn,
Flows down in muddy streams and steady
Fluff in his hair, with visored cap
Fluff up her hair as style commands.
Fly, my darlings, run away.
Foot it neatly on the green!
For (as I’ve said) there he must sit 
For 1808 without a binding:
For Eugene to behold him there 
For God knows whom inspired your soul, 
For Lensky, the cotillion seemed 
For Olga’s album — not a bit!
For Petersburg’s no sleepyhead.
For a few books, a wilderness
For a long time . . . indeed, forever.
For all her future social cares 
For all that musty rhetoric.
For all the efforts she is making.
For all their views and passions not,
For all through Russia there will run 
For all your great gifts and your least, 
For army service; kept the books;
For as it is, my style is peppered
For carefree youth knows no regret.
For dreams, and would have been a shame.
For epigrams it would be splendid . . .
For epigrams, and was annoyed 
For four long years she had been ailing.
For friendship’s sake would I were writing
For glory will be hers, and treasure!”
For gossip is not held a crime.
For happiness. Good God! I see
For he is welcome everywhere.
For here, Napoleon, elated
For honor could require no less.
For if they sing, they can’t be eating
For it is late, the shortest way;
For just those little slips of grammar;
For lady never, no, not one.
For learning takes an utter fool.
For marriage bond or marriage bell;
For me? Shall I yet see you winging 
For ravings that it may induce.
For rustic freedom thus delights,
For six weeks yearly be a mess, a 
For such a life, I am afiraid.
For such mere trifles? Why repine 
For the corvee he substituted
For the cotillion begs her hand.
For the first time in any novel
For the good-byes; the turn-out waits. 
For the most costly merchandise 
For the wild steppes’ barbaric tongues,
For there’s a lack of taste in us.
For this new hero prithee feel a
For though the country boasts no palace,
For thus he brings his passion’s fuel
For trousers^ dress-coat^ and for vest;
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
For woman is a tender fool,
For worldly shows and vanities.
For, sad to say, she loved another:
Forbidden fruits alone entice —
Forced me to tear my heart away;
Forget the feelings that held riot
Forgetting friends and city ways
Forgive me, then, for thus retreating. 
Forgive me: Tanya, from the start,
Forgive the tears you wring from me,
Forgotten bridges rot and sink;
Forth rushes greedy youth to capture 
Forward, with groan and grunt he lunges,
Found a white picture to surprise her:
Found nothing fit to fill his life.
Four steps toward a narrow bed.
Framed somberly by gentlemen.
Free from digressions Chapter Five.
Freely the poet spoke and truly,
French choreographer established in Russia.
French dishes for the gourmet’s tooth.
French prelate who was Napoleon’s chaplain; his 
French turns will please me in a sentence
French writer.
Fresh grief would cause a keener smart —
Friends, for the poet you are grieving,
From Eugene: he was far too jaded —
From Istamboul may not be here.
From Northern snows: you loved to tread 
From a moth-eaten almanac;
From all the heart holds dear, my blunder
From distant streets where cabs were flying, 
From early youth his dedication
From head to foot, in form or face.
From here he watched with thoughtful eyes
From his affection; they were these:
From hour to hour yet more enraptured
From misty Germany, Vladimir 
From nearby hills the snow, already
From our good friends, may Heaven save us!
From porch to court, and shadow-light 
From shipboard looming on the sight
From shipboard, thunder dawn, than I, 
From speech: you never would have learned
From that dull hole . . And his lorgnette
From the drawn bow the arrow leaping
From the hussar, Pykhtin, who used
From their twin lanterns as they go.
From then on he never left the Emperor’s side. In 
From these the man might be inferred.
From thoughts of him she is not firee;
From two to thirty, in a row;
Frost glistens. Mother Winter’s arts
Fruit of spoiled years, or green and tart,
Full soon my errant Muse was proving
GRIBOYEDOV
Games kindred in monotony.
Gave up his dreams as wild and silly:
Gay carriages, a goodly number,
Girls, strike up a melody.
Give way in turn to common sense:
Given to mournful reverie.”
Glass after glass is drained in drenching
Gleam white; the sleigh, more swift than steady. 
Glimpse of Terpsichore’s sweet foot. 
Glimpsing behind the distant bushes 
Go with the solemn folk who bore you.
God’s servant, and a brigadier,
God grant it’s nothing! Welladay!
God grant you find some trifle here
Goes out at once, demands a horse.
Goethe and Schiller were his masters.
Gold pines, and live Limburger cheese.
Gone with the styles we do not use,
Good neighbor who’s dropped in on me,
Good readers: a new face arrives.
Graved on the monument you see:
Gravely departed priest and guest.
Gray skies, and heaps of straw in billows
Great by Shirinsky-Shikhmatov and Gruzintzev.
Great ladies, far too proud to fall,
Great ladies, of whom he’d been fond; 
Greek names, as, for example, Agathon, Philat, Theo- 
Green tables are set up, alluring
Grew worldly-wise as life grew chilly,
Griboyedov’s famous comedy, Woe From Wit.
Grieves for the wretch throughout her life,
Grow fond — out of sheer idleness.
Guests bow and scrape within the door.
Guillot is standing, ill at ease.
Gulnare’s bold singer emulating,
Gustave de Linar: a character in Valerie, a novel by 
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
H’m, h’m! dear reader, pray apprise me.
HORACE
HOW CAN ONE NOT LOVE MOSCOW, PRAY?
Had Eugene, from a little bird.
Had been refurbished, yawn he must.
Had brought the fruits of learning’s tree: 
Had chased him and had quickly caught him.
Had gout at forty, fat and flabby;
Had he been quicker in revealing —
Had he but known the wounding sorrow
Had her shy wistful heart been burning; 
Had made the choice, ’twas not her own;
Had marked the place; and, more attentive, 
Had shown to my enchanted glance 
Half-grave, half-gay, and with a flavor 
Hard pavements, like a coat of mail.
Harold.
Has been diluted heavily.
Has clothed a hopeless egoism 
Has found a refuge from the blast 
Has held the first place in my heart.
Has sent you, and I shall be leaning 
Has she the answer to the riddle
Has thrilled by night the silent dale.
Have acted with intelligence.
Have been away! Before you vanish 
Have been content to eat and drink,
Have cards and dice; and not for naught 
Have dimmed the golden coal; half-seen,
Have given me prestige? Be frank!
Have learned how hearts can be tormented.
Have paid to folly what’s her due.
Have passages on nature vying 
Have passed since in a hazy vision 
Have played a prank in coquetry.
Have seen such ladies, not a few
Have there been any conflagrations?
Have they arrived? His calculations
Have your own horses pull your coaches,
Having attained to twenty -six —
Having her album there to finger,
Having, to satisfy a whim.
He’d catch the moment of emotion.
He’d had a glimpse of his estate;
He’d have disarmed the youthful heart.
He’d led a kind and simple life;
He’d stroll into the drawing-room 
He’d suffer bonds again, provided 
He’d suffered j&rom such things for years.
He’d take his fascinating pen 
He’ll then resume till day is breaking
He’s dignified, he dyes his hair.
He’s done with women, and it looks 
He’s driven from the ball to bed:
He’s in, and flying to the mill.
He’s killed! The fearful affirmation
He’s read and read, and pray, what for?
He’s sent to doctors, the Neva’s
He Hked debate, and sometimes rudely
He barely spoke; his urgent mission
He bowed to her without a word.
He calls for help, in misery;
He came, unripe, unto the tomb!
He came. And her eyes opened. Quaking,
He can no longer be enchanted,
He cannot give me happiness.”
He caught the post with eager haste,
He comes upon her, as he enters.
He comes: a cork pops, up it goes.
He could forget himself completely.
He counts the slow hours, vainly trying
He curses women’s whim with force.
He dares to trifle with a tress
He decorates it earnestly:
He did not die or go insane.
He did not know that books could say things
He did not stir, but like one dreaming
He did not value letters much.
He did stop short of suicide.
He died a short hour before dinner.
He dined here. What fine gentlemen!
He dined, he danced, he fenced, he rode.
He does not cease his stubborn stare:
He does not even guess my pain.
He does not heed the mind’s reproaches,
He drinks: with greedy howls they swill;
He dropped his eyes in irritation
He early knew the agitation
He early played the fond deceiver.
He erred; for Eugene, hardy sinner.
He feared that he had not incited
He feels that it must break with grieving. 
He fell from off a Kalmuck stallion.
He finds that no remarks occur
He first abandoned you, capricious
He fled their noisy conversation
He found it puzzling but alluring;
He found the fairest faces null;
He found the matter not too clear.
He frowns, and everyone is still;
He gazes, and his heart is riven:
He gives his man the arms to carry
He goes in to the princess, quaking;
He had no itch to dig for glories
He had some other expectation?
He has a single thought to ponder:
He has it still — a touching note,
He held that loyal friends and steady
He held that some by Fate were chosen
He holds a stocking he was mending;
He hoped that in good time I’d marry
He hows to sundry friends; his mocking
He is the victim of remorse.
He is, though not renowned or quoted,
He joins the throng on the boulevard^
He killed eight years thus like a dunce —
He knew one constant inspiration.
He knew one torment, one delight
He knew the ruses that would brighten
He knew the task would sorely try him
He knows dehght when he’s adjusting
He laughs, and they are all guffawing;
He lay most strangely there at rest.
He lays her down upon the sill.
He leads her, nonchalantly gliding.
He leaves the ladies’ hands unkissed;
He left his rustics to their tillage,
He let the classic laurel fade,
He let the summer season fly,
He listened to young Lensky, smiling:
He lived — in summer rose at seven;
He lived in quite another age);
He looked the poet, when he’d let a
He looked them over, boxed them right,
He loved as people love no longer
He loved me, and the dawn of life
He loved the dark and shunned the daytime,
He loves you ... as a relative!
He marked the time, and presently
He marks the hour with some dismay:
He may pick up her handkerchief.
He might have altered and deserted
He might have gone to bed and died
He might have learned that life was shabby
He must be off without delay.
He never thought of the vexation 
He noted with accustomed malice.
He now repents him of the course
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
He offered solace and delight,
He offers all a grand example;
He often paid a call, surmising 
He paid the Muses honor due;
He passes over in a rush
He pens, with trembling hand and weak,
He pours out fluent melodies;
He quits his place of hibernation —
He quits the rout, and, meditating.
He racked his brains, and still believed
He read at will: Gibbon, Rousseau,
He read miscellany and journal.
He rescued them, and with the knack
He said, and found his words the cue
He sang life’s bloom and early blight:
He sang of parting and repining;
He sang the rose, romantic flower;
He savors the few words that settle
He scorned most men (not every one).
He seems to see his Olga there
He seems, indeed, an alien here,
He sees forgotten foes, malicious 
He sees the self-willed Terek flinging
He set his mind to work with zest.
He set the ladies’ eyes aglow.
He sighed, no longer subject to them:
He sighs: ^'They’re past the age — it’s shocking! 
He soon consigns them to perdition. 
He spared the rod to spoil the boy,
He spared us, true, one piece of folly;
He swam this Hellespont anew,
He talked about the wealth of nations;
He thought it no great loss — perchance
He thought the tomes his daughter kept
He thought: I must not disconcert him
He thrust his nose in right away.
He took his coffee here, and rested,
He took, and fain would be forgiven;
He trembles, cannot say a word,
He turned a partial eye on it.
He waits with jealous indignation
He waits: and up a troika prances,
He wakes to find a note — that’s pleasant:
He walks into the empty lobby.
He wanted to converse with her
He was a veteran in love.
He was convinced the fickle fair
He was in bliss. Indeed, thrice blessed 
He was no fool; and Eugene, ready
He was none of your poetasters,
He was not one to pick and choose.
He watched her as she played and sang;
He waved his hand, as one who’d rue it
He well knew how to set you laughing.
He who could never understand
He will lie late, and on Ms tray 
He wore a dressing-gown himself;
He would implore the shy confession.
He would not play the base deceiver.
He writes a verse for her to dote on —
He yawns and starts to snore again.
He yawns, for serious labor tries him.
Headlong into a world unknown.
Hear my confession, then, I pray.
Held Richardson as dear as life.
Heloise; Clarissa: the heroine of Clarissa Harlotve; 
Her anguished heart some peace w as granteti
Her billowy soft rugs are flung;
Her cheek rests on her hand, and she
Her chest heaves, and her cheeks are kindled 
Her countrified simplicity 
Her darkening eyes she never raises;
Her dear familiar room shows plain,
Her dove, her confidante devoted,
Her dowdy frocks, and to their mercies 
Her dreams in every circumstance 
Her dreamy mood did not consort
Her eyes betray her with a tear.
Her eyes shine, and her breath has dwindled.
Her face would pale, her body quivered.
Her father saw no harm in reading
Her flaxen hair, her graceful poses.
Her flowers, her romantic novels,
Her fondness for them never changing.
Her gauzy veil aside to see 
Her grief into the garden taking,
Her growing doubts they cannot still.
Her heart assailed, where’er she went 
Her heart was filled with one alone.
Her heart, and when she likes, 'withdraws, 
Her husband, in the corner, dozing,
Her in the princess readily!
Her languor will not let her move.
Her look, so candid and serene.
Her looks, her words — he does not flatter.
Her love in Russian has confided;
Her lowered eyes agleam the while,
Her manner was what it had been
Her melancholy eyes adore him —
Her mind with agitation seething,
Her motion, in pure splendor dressed!
Her nightgown slips from off her shoulder,
Her passion, not by chance or skill; 
Her pet, Rossini, must be heard.
Her prudent husband, to distract her.
Her rosy cheeks are not less bright
Her rosy innocence and grace.
Her sad fatigue, her helpless languor.
Her sister tempts the Muse, not she.
Her sky-blue eyes, her cheeks like roses,
Her small wet slipper’s next to go.
Her son! to distant regions fled,
Her soul was waiting . . . ah, for whom?
Her spouse had not a word to say.
Her sweet simplicity of mien! . . .
Her tender fingers sewed no seam,
Her tender voice is like a reed’s.
Her terror held a secret charm:
Her trailing skirt, with hand that quivers;
Her trinkets rudely from her tearing;
Her virgin calm is of the past;
Her voice, were such as they portray
Her voiceless grief was past disguising;
Her walks are longer, she will dally
Her weakness, and she coughed and cried.
Her well-bound quarto to inscribe,
Her work the crackling matchwood lights,
Her worth, each year more sullen growing. 
Here’s Petushkov, a rural beau;
Here’s Pradt and Scott. You do not think
Here’s bronze and china in profusion.
Here’s every dainty that you please:
Here’s the exordium. That’s that!
Here’s what you find there (am I right?) :
Here’s winter! . . . The triumphant peasant
Here an ambassador was weighing 
Here at my feet. But dare you say 
Here comes Gvozdin, a first-rate farmer
Here dandies now in the ascendant
Here fashionables would repair.
Here in the world’s benumbing rapture, 
Here in this village unfrequented.
Here is a ball, and there a party;
Here is a door — ^he flings it wide,
Here not a wit was found to shine
Here one heard naught but echoes, dying,
Here the patricians congregated.
Here too the plainsman comes and brags,
Here was Onegin, then, possessing
Here was a man who had a weakness
Here you will find as decoration
Here, bonneted and wearing roses,
Here, mornings, he would read his book . . . 
Hers is a calm simplicity.
Herself to love and all its laws.
Hi Dashed off; arrived; and heartily
Hi Too ill for hopes of getting better,
Hi Yet brighter shines the moon than any
High tragedy and swoons and tears,
Highways to make the country one.
Himself back to his regiment.
Himself so deep in it that he 
Himself transformed into a horse;
Himself, even in privacy.
Himself, his dinner, and his wife.
His Olga. I can hear him say:
His appetite for pleasure’s hearty —
His bride was soon content to be 
His course no more; but, oh, most dear,
His courting now was minus zest;
His cup of tea with rum deserting,
His debt to nature has been paid.
His door he locks, his lamp he trims.
His doubts were never past the curing,
His doubts: for meet they surely will 
His dressing-gown and slippers bringing,
His drowsy eyes, and draws aside 
His early years were all a waste.
His enemies were always base.
His epitaph is plain as he;
His eyes, how tender, quick and clear.
His father listened, frowned, and groaned.
His friend [Kaverin] must be waiting.
His friend for thus misleading him;
His friend unburdened himself of —
His gentle touch nowise dismays her.
His hair cut in the latest mode;
His hand upon his breast lays lightly.
His head above her fondly bent,
His heart is all but crushed with pain,
His heart is by such anguish bitten
His heart leaps up, his soul is stirred.
His heart the nest of fond illusion,
His heart was pure, his conscience clear;
His heart with sore repentance filled.
His housekeeper for forty years,
His illness — ^name it how you choose,
His jealousy and his vexation
His knowledge of the tongue was slight:
His life, that knew no cares or labors,
His madness — and again immerses 
His magic presence hovers round her;
His mare scents snow upon the pleasant
His mind was ever far away;
His mood no gloomier, no gayer;
His mother stands and threatens him.
His music therewith sweetly c h im i ng;
His nag has ribs that might be counted. 
His neighbor, calling out his name,
His news sets girlish hearts to drumming:
His nineteenth year was scarce in sight.
His oars above the drowsy stream;
His page is empty as can be.
His passing came as a disaster
His pocket burns: it holds a treasure,
His precious Olga: such is love!
His principal accomplishment;
His roans bring Lensky to the door;
His sentiments were fine and true.
His sharp intelligence and chilly,
His slightest move is overawing;
His son was married recently.
His son, Lieutenant General I. A. Annibal, was
His soul’s innate nobility;
His soul by highest motives guided,
His spirit knew their lyric jSre.
His stables, forests, streams and land.
His strain was languid, dark (romantic
His toast rings out the first of all,
His uncle’s in his cofl&n laid:
His verses like a river flow.
His virgin lyric was of her.
His was the love of poets, stronger 
His way of dreaming, willy-nilly.
His wedding was a settled matter.
His were the dreams that move the heart
His whims; 0 hover thou above 
His worn shoe slipping on the ice,
Hither to our frolic and 
Hold on, old fellow, that will do . . .
Hold your lorgnette up, watch them nearly.
Holding their pious habits dear;
Homeward, along the kitchen-garden;
Hope lies to them, and they’re beguiled.
Hope of a name none might forget.
Hoping her grief might thus abate;
Hoping to sell his worthless nags;
Horns and a quilted dressing-gown;
How ardently this breast was burning! 
How blessed the lover who is granted
How blessed, indeed . . . though she might choose
How can I help you, only say!
How changed Tatyana is! How truly
How dismal to be sturdy. Lord,
How dismal to be young, and bored!”
How dismal!
How heavenly, as she advances,
How is it that you do not fall 
How jfirmly her attention centers
How justly now I am afflicted.
How many chapters Fate has closed! 
How many follies then were floating
How many swiftly flitting days 
How much of life I spent in vain.
How noble was the tone he’d taken;
How oft on the dark shores of Tauris
How often, sick with separation,
How once I held her stirrup for her,
How sad I find you! How you flood 
How sad it is to be forgetting!
How very welcome you will be.”
However dazzling to the sight.
However, was no Grandison.
Husbands esteemed, to you I tender —
Hymen prepares to strew our way,
I’d bring you nothing but distress.
I’d give my house and all that’s in it.
I’d like to see with my own eyes
I’d live through every ball again.
I’ll bring them to the altar then . . .
I’ll give the censorship its due.
I’ll go!” And he does not defer
I’ll have a duel with my friend.
I’ll not debate the point. Ye gods!
I’ll sprinkle you with holy water.
I’ll tell no ghostly tales, or gory.
I’m bored; tell me a story, dear.”
I’m sad and cold, and yet it seems 
I’ve a suspicion, make me ill.
I’ve always thought well suited to 
I’ve drawn a likeness perfectly:
I’ve fallen on black days, my dear —
I’ve finished cantos nine, no more;
I’ve haunted the ballet — what for?
I’ve married off my younger daughter,
I’ve scanned the pages most severely.
I . . . I’m in love,” she murmured low.
I And you, small fruit of eager labor:
I He’d greet the hour so long awaited.
I The taw^dry glitter of her vesture.
I am assailed by melancholy;
I am deceived by no illusion;
I am not given to repentance —
I blame you . . . For you acted boldly. 
I bow and cede my rights to you . . .
I boxed your ears! I gave you cakes!”
I burned, my pulses started drumming.
I call on freedom — ^naught avails:
I called Odessa dusty —
I can’t go out: I cannot walk —
I cannot say; I’ve talked so long
I cannot suffer the discussion —
I choke him with a tragedy;
I could not see it without gloating,
I court the Muse with indolence.
I did not ache with such desire
I drag myself about; timers hasting.
I fain would write a diatribe —
I fear lest in my supplication
I fear, friends, lest your patience fail:
I find the plain home circle dear.
I first resolved upon refraining
I first saw young Tatyana glide 
I found you good, and I attest 
I freeze — good God! — ^recalling how
I frighten the wild ducks by rolling
I hardly read, I’m often dozing.
I hate red lips that are unsmiling,
I have known women, stern and rigid.
I have no care for flighty fame;
I have no faith in its requiting
I have no tears, in spite of grief;
I have seen other belles who bent
I have them here for you to see:
I hear the magic of your voice,
I heard her friendly accents soften;
I know that life is but a bubble,
I know there’ll be a warm reception
I know your heart; I need not tremble.
I left you in a dreadful fright;
I like a life of country quiet;
I liked, and his peculiar pose;
I listened, not without elation.
I looked for peace in prayer, kneeling.
I lose the thread, my mind’s not clear.
I love fierce youth, my private passion
I love you (why should I dissemble?)
I loved your image even then;
I loved, and nothing could relieve me. 
I married. Now, I beg you, go.
I marveled at their iron virtue,
I might (who knows?) have grown contented.
I might indeed make bold to borrow
I moved there also for a while,
I must admit the sorry truth,
I must be certain in the morning
I must be growing dull, I fear.
I must say candid words or none.
I pace the beach, await good weather.
I quote myself, and do it pat).
I read a shy, confiding word.
I read not to the crowd, but only
I reminisced of the attraction
I sadly call on each sweet name.
I say: give up a style outmoded.
I see the pain has left no trace;
I shall be true to him through life.”
I shall defy the dread ApoUo,
I shall lose patience soon, of course:
I shall not suffer the deceiver
I shall recall the tongue of longing.
I share the scalding tears you drop:
I strolled into the farmyard — faugh!
I take a stroll. Now cups are clinking
I take my leave of you — farewell.
I tasted all your joys with zest;
I thank you from my inmost soul . . .
I thought to paint (see Chapter One)
I throw myself on your compassion . . .
I too had dropped, and found him then — 
I took this peace, this liberty.
I treasure it most piously;
I trembled at your glance, and when
I trust that you will pardon me;
I try to glimpse it; but I trust 
I understood them not at all.
I vurite you, and my act is serving
I w-ould not praise you, but sincerely
I w-ould requite sincerity;
I wait: when once your look has spoken.
I want my peace, my pot of stchi.
I want to cry, to sob — oh, nursey!”
I was a dolt and could not sing.
I was embittered, he morose.
I was in too much haste, I fear;
I was not bom for happiness;
I watched her spouse, with time to spare;
I would not leave the world, unknown.
I would prefer your harsh cold fashion
I write, and longing is diminished;
I, too, recalling poor Svetlana,

IV And melancholy minus reason.

IV And you who bask in fortune’s favor.

If for a moment I found pleasure
If friends and kin are undeserving.
If he goes home, his dreams still linger
If not, my dear. I’ll see you through.”
If on the left she would espy
If only you were with me still,
If out of date, the lofty ceiling.
If she encountered, unaware,
If there had been a hope remaining
If there w'as carping comment, too;
If true delight you would afford him
If you but knew how agonizing
If you have any mind to flirt, you
If you recall your Tanya still,
Ignores what happened yesterday,
Imagine: here I am alone.
Immersed in it the houses founder;
Impatient, twitch beneath the lamp.
Important folk, and is it true 
Impulsiveness may lead to grief.”
In French he could converse politely.
In Olga’s presence poor Vladimir
In Orient luxury once cherished.
In Richardson as in Rousseau.
In Russia, where for lack of historical memoirs,
In Russian? And the task’s infernal. 
In Say and Bentham for her chatter. 
In all the novels of the day.
In any small degree betrayed her:
In billiards, with a good blunt cue 
In cantos numbering twenty -five!
In catching Tanya’s eye, she took 
In chorus the old ladies cry:
In colored silks a pattern fit 
In cosy comfort, sleeping sweetly.
In cosy scenes of fireside life.
In deep reflection, hot discussion.
In dizzy circles round and round, 
In dread of what this might forebode;
In dress a pedant and a fop.
In dust . . . But there the skies are bright; 
In elegiac mood, at last 
In endless reverie indulging,
In every nook, with strange emotion;
In fancying a happy tryst 
In festive crowds, in solitude.
In flannels and a night-cap too.
In full the tender story duly,
In gentle whispers with her nurse.
In golden languor vaguely floating;
In gossip finds the spice of life,
In grave seclusion as is fit.
In hacked as well as hackneyed verse 
In her room w"hile the light is flitting;
In his first youth he w'as the prey
In ink or colors he is sketching
In its seductive figments now!
In judgment on himself could be 
In kerchief and long gown of wool.
In many guises she comes flying:
In mind: that if I had my will,
In mischief, but horrific stories 
In nothing, but can never rest.
In our lime too, in days of old),
In our poetic reverie
In passing that my stanzas speak 
In praise of so much wit and charm.
In praises of his hardihood;
In reverie they would dissolve;
In runs his valet, prompt Guillot,
In saturnine romanticism.
In secret Tanya was repining;
In secret, of dear distant creatures.
In short, and I was proud of her.
In shouting fiercely: ^^Mine! She’s mine!”
In silence, hearing still the faint
In solitude without a flaw,
In soul, of all the guests the least 
In spite of all oinr efforts, too.
In still and somber beauty stand
In such a brief and tragic fashion —
In such a year, at such an age;
In talk of love. It was thought shameless — 
In that same hamlet where of yore 
In that swift moment one could see
In the dark hours ere Morpheus, flying,
In the mazurka, ’twas allowed.
In the same carefree lively way 
In the smart sanctum, all a -quiver,
In the soft luxury of feeling,
In the steep shade a camel lying;
In the thick grass where none can see,
In the unruj63ed heavens shining;
In this affair our friend was tested
In this case it is not too strong
In this important sport the jaded
In this opinion all concur.
In those white hands would be distressing! 
In time I shall relate the rest.
In time, my readers, you shall hear
In time-worn halls and those that just
In to her sister, swallow-light;
In token of our warm regard.
In torment at your feet to swoon —
In town), with pots and pans and gear 
In tracking you! I should be moving 
In triumph at the joyous shore;
In truth what brought you here today? 
In turn Ms fickle flattery brings.
In uniform . . . Now he is walking 
In vain a Moscow on her knees 
In vain into the darkness staring
In vain she struggles to escape;
In vain the belles might clamor for him.
In which, God help us, we are stuck.
In winter when the nights were wild.
In winter, when night’s shade encloses
In worldly dazzle and confusion
In your imported carriage, pray
In youth, were such the joys I’d count on?
Inane and petty, while the ode
Increase the din of celebration;
Indeed what can I hope for ^ after
Indeed, he soon received a letter
Indeed, you played a noble role:
Indoors, the maid will softly sing
Indulge in lovers’ dreams with ease;
Infer, then, with what thorny roses
Inflames the girl’s conceited face;
Inscribing albums of this kind:
Inscription written: ”Ye surrender 
Inserting: belle Tatiana.
Inspired Mickiewicz used to stand 
Inspired by tender melancholy,
Instead of bristling at the start —
Instruct the fair without a word.
Into a meadow sweet with bloom.
Into a more exacting book.
Into one image, her heart leaping 
Into the flooded meadowlands.
Into the pan the powder’s sifted,
Into the silent study, setting
Into the stream her red-webbed foot,
Into the woods, pursued, she presses;
Invite her, kiss her, press her hands.

Is alien to my breast, and brings

Is all they give us as a rule,
Is bound up with the servants’ hall.
Is brought, and Dunya pours his tea;
Is but a flirt. Though she is barely 
Is but the wistful moon’s, alas! . , «
Is but to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
Is dashing in the cab he hired.
Is dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
Is for the good old-fashioned ways.
Is forced to curtsey, to his bow.
Is gaily whirling overhead,
Is half a crane and half a cat.
Is he bewitched? It’s very droll.
Is he from Heaven or from Hades?
Is heedless of the friendly clapping;
Is honor’s mainspring. I’ll be bound —
Is hushed. Alone the angry chorus
Is in these parlous days unknown;
Is it because her love is artless.
Is it because intelligence
Is it because she cannot deem
Is it because we like to sit
Is it that I was born to languish.
Is it the music’s fascination
Is just as deaf and just as meek.
Is launched into eternity.
Is like Van Dyck’s Madonna. Fie!
Is like a copy pale and vicious,
Is lost to us, and he shall never 
Is more than could have been expected:
Is now our hero’s, it appears.
Is slobbered over bit and traces.
Is snatched away from her by Fate
Is southern winter’s travesty;
Is surrogate for happiness.
Is the benign and silent moon;
Is the shrewd elegance of fashion,
Is there a sign of tears? No trace! 
Is this world shut for aye to him?
Is trained on her whose features dimly 
Is weeping, weeping quietly.
Istomina on lifted toe.
It’s frowned on in society.
It’s late. Odessa sleeps, unruffled;
It’s like a mistress, gay, capricious,
It’s maddening to see before you
It’s misery, and who can cure it?”
It’s over. Having supped, the gentry 
It’s plain that here he is the master.
It’s time he ceased to be a show . .
It all pours forth from lips that tremble
It all, in detail, never fear.
It causes frenzy, aberrations.
It happened that a peddler tendered
It humbly asks romantic fame.
It is a phantom you are chasing,
It is my letter, don’t you see.
It is no wonder I am fretting . .
It is to parch with hot desire^
It makes no difference to her.
It may be Lethe will not cover;
It may be, in your glory flourished.
It may not be: without relief,
It means the people to whose faces
It suits my Muse as it suits me.
It waited on, for him alone;
It was decreed ... the will of Heaven
It was for you that I neglected
It was he came to visit me.
It was his pleasure quietly
It was today I met the beauty;
It wrong to scorn when pride commanded —
Its aim is high, its meaning mighty . .
Its classic grace draws in its wake
Its fateful harassments indeed
Its love or anger, grief or joy;
Its parti-colored pageantry.
Its passage, it has ceased to be.
Its pleasures, like the city’s, pall.
Its reckless growth: into the grave 
Its splendor among ancient trees,
Its tale of humble lives, where now 
Its waves on shores that rise up sheer;
Its wings with crazy motions twirling;
Itself upon its memories.
Iv But it is time I was returning
Iv There fancies bloom and dreams run riot —
Ivan Petrovich ne’er was keen,

Ivii I too made it my occupation

JA MORALE EST DANS LA NATURE DES CHOSES.
Julie, Clarissa, or Delphine;
Just as the social rites demanded.
Just as the stars had left off dancing.
Just fancy who appears from under!
Just for a dash of lemon waiting.
Just for the sake of being heard.
Just here and there hard labor lately
Just now a walk w’ould suit me best.
Just now our roads are bad for coaches;
Just now, did I not see you flitting
Just think, this joy, I can’t endure it.
Just to enjoy the obsequies.

Lamenting in new songs and dirges 
Late nights, yes, and a facile art;
Lay hid in all the prose they uttered —
Lays claim to the young girl’s attention; 
Leading his offspring, Kharlikov;
Leaps for a knife, and Lensky falls;
Led me to church. I had to go.
Left of the village where the poet
Lensky can scarcely trust his eyes.
Lensky was thought an eligible,
Lest the young lady should be hurt.
Lest they should miss us beyond reason
Lest, sick of pleasure, momently
Let’s call some time. Take my advice;
Let alone grief ... I have no strength . . .
Let critics carp, he will not grovel:
Let critics wreak their indignation
Let him believe in wonders still
Let me look back. Farewell, then, bowers
Let no sly reader be so daring —
Let not the poet’s heart know capture
Let the sonorous stanzas roll;
Lies in your hands, for you to fashion;
Lies spread the famous annual fair.
Life’s vista gleams before it yet.
Life was a riddle he would solve.
Light nothings, spoken without guile 
Light quit-rent, and the slave, well suited
Like Byron, pride’s consummate poet;
Like Delwig drunk in company.
Like Hippocrene it sparkles brightly.
Like Petrarch, he finds love less cruel. 
Like Venus’ very self emerging.
Like a Bacchante at the revels.
Like a poor sot to shelter reeling
Like any illness: spleen, or plague;
Like bees that from the hive are pouring 
Like fellowship, as I regale 
Like fevers it can burn and freeze us.
Like fire, the gilded crosses rise 
Like giddy youth forever swirling
Like leaves that in wet autumn stray. 
Like madness make us wild and vague;
Like pale Lenore, by moonlight she
Like prisoners released in sleep
Like secret promenades in sleighs;
Like silver dust the snowflakes lie.
Like smoke across the azure drifted;
Like this decrepit publican?
Like this since first the world began;
Like those whom an old feud inflames.
Like to the moon in lonely pride.

My Lensky’s fury grows apace;
My Moscow offered Bonaparte —
My Muse to a superb soiree;
My brainless pupil almost learned
My childish dreams, my tender years,
My conscience speaks — ^pray let me finish;
My country, and an exile’s lot —
My cousin, sleepy-eyed Buyanov,
My days are counted: Fve had warning;
My dear, is an important matter:
My dear, when old age comes at length
My earnest counsels prithee heed.
My fair Russian Terpsichore?
My flighty friend made quite a stir.
My fondness for it is but slight;
My friends. Perhaps, by heaven’s decree,
My frivolous and merry youth!
My girlish dreams forever stilled.
My goddesses! How shall I trace you?
My handsome house and my soirees —
My heart to one, and one alone!
My heart will as of old be shaken.
My high-flown fancies have departed.

My labors, yet perhaps this name 
My legs betray me . . . But it’s tiring

My little book. With you I knew
My little nook do not forsake;
My lively cousin now advancing.
My love, first warm, would soon diminish,

My mother coaxed and wept; the sequel
My mother-in-law would have raged.”

My thanks. Alike in peace and riot 
My thoughts in exile turned to you,

Nay, she must hate her brother’s slayer.
Near by (when springtime rains have peppered
Near by, she saw the mansion standing.
Neva, oh, offspring of my pen.
Never shall I my soul renew . . .
New leaves for those the tempests scatter. 
New sorrows come, my heart to fret;
New warmth has melted winter’s chain; 
Next day before the sun was high.
Night falls; the moon, already riding
No bard was keen as I to follow
No breath disturbs the warm still night.
No card-game, poetry, or ball.
No coarse mot of a witty snob.
No fancy of a worldly mob.
No feast, no gift to warm his heart:
No finer, but just finicky.
No gift but weariness and anguish 
No grace, no flash of merriment.
No longer fearful of disaster.
No look, no tremor, not a word
No matter— ah, but look with favor
No matter. Why should we be asking
No matter: lisping like a child,
No more I find it quite so pressing
No more a reason for emotion,
No more can hoyden rhymes detain me,
No more my Eugene could discern . . .
No more the casual pen is led 
No more the vogue, you will allow.
No other entertainment needing.
No partner ever was so sprightly.
No punishment is equal to it.
No respite to his heart is granted —
No rival in the girl’s affection . , .
No rung would suit him but the top —
No savoir vivre^ no hint of verse;
No shadow could be faithfuUer.
No single sound escapes from her;
No smart conceits does Lensky fashion
No sooner did the cannon, sounding
No sound, save for the soft slow roar
No syllable of sentiment.
No witty thought occurs, no word
No, passion never wrought for me
No, silent, wild, and melancholy,
No, soon the world began to bore him.
No, to he with you constantly;
No, when with youth and love on fire,
Noise, chatter, on the table shine
None was so quick as he at trapping
Nor bends to fashion’s tyrannies:
Nor calls them, noons, for mustering;
Nor cards, nor gossip, chased his gloom; 
Nor distance, changed his earnest mood
Nor eases tears too long suppressed.
Nor from his greedy lips withdraws 
Nor full of idle chat and silly;
Nor noisy games, nor foreign beauties.
Nor read the ending of the story.
Nor reckoned days as they went by,
Nor shown a fighter’s predilection.
Nor soothes the ache within her breast.
Nor studies such as pedants choose,
Nor was she found with head inclining
Nor yet the cuckold, stout and haughty.
Nor yet were her soft lips compressed.
Nor, from the loge and the parterre,
Not aiming yet, advance four paces.
Not all Onegin’s observation
Not deep or learned or intense.
Not for you our songs are sung.
Not hesitating to awake him.
Not hours when he fulfilled the duties
Not knowing in the morning where
Not knowing you, I would not thus
Not like a cool coquette w^ho tenders
Not long the Larin house was waking
Not now. I love my hero truly.
Not now: we, like the ladies, proudly
Not only did she fail to shiver.
Not pain, but death. Thus, sparkling whitely
Not so his calculating neighbor
Not thus have sought to cut a dash.
Not what you have, but what you see 
Not with a notion of delighting 
Notes here. Those not marked ^'Pushkin” have been added
Nothing attracted his attention.
Now I am at your mercy, guided
Now Lovelace’s renown is faded.
Now Olga sits before it, filling
Now Yule-tide brings its fun and folly.
Now cut the ice with scraping noise;
Now different scenes delight my senses:
Now five steps more the pair have made.
Now from the dish where they are lying
Now from the shed at crack of dawn
Now having given due attention
Now in his study he bethought him
Now met his spouse. The princess gazed 
Now my Onegin, keen as brandy.
Now my companions are inquiring:
Now nearer! Galloping . . . and here 
Now on what flowers are they set?
Now serpentine she twists and wheels,
Now sleeps the scion of delight.
Now soothed by this anticipation.
Now southward swept the caravan
Now stirred? Is it vexation moving 
Now the mazurka’s strains are sounding.
Now through the open meadow faring,
Now with what eager concentration
Now" let me speak of something jolly.
O’er Petersburg’s dark pavements borne 
O’er her embroidery, designing 
O’ergrown. No wreath hangs on the bough; 
OH, YES, what’s FAR AWAY, THAT WE PREFER!
ONEGIN’S LETTER
ONEGIN TRAVELS TO ASTRAKHAN,
Obeying folly’s least suggestion,
Obeying the spring sun’s commands,
Obeys her feelings sans demur?
Oblige me! Is it such hard labor?”
Oblivion is waiting for us
Observe his closet well, and gage
Observe it with a yawn at last,
Observed the girl’s embarrassed air.
Obtaining, with himself to thank.
Odessa was my home then, shrouded
Of Cleopatra, but whose features.
Of Lensky’s troth there was no chatter:
Of Lovelace or of Grandison,
Of Moscow beaus and Moscow Circes!
Of Olga’s looks alive to me.
Of Sundays, putting on his glasses,
Of a most tyrannous young fop.
Of all sorts; finally you hear 
Of all the dreams the heart can hold.
Of any nonsense I set down,
Of comme il faut — Shishkov, berate 
Of corks, with much the same attention 
Of course you’ve often seen that treasure.
Of course young Lensky felt no yearning
Of course, one should reward his gabble
Of curses: he’s gone home to change.
Of days long past, when he had been
Of destiny and its defiance.
Of distance, promising delight;
Of elegies at some far date 
Of fables, and a grammar too.
Of feasts and sundry foods and eke 
Of finding worn-out prejudices.
Of fools, and slyly whispered quips ...”
Of good and evil, and of science,
Of heels the stout parquet would quake,
Of heirs is heard, indecently 
Of her companions in the blue.
Of her demure provincial ways,
Of her own heart’s shy hopes and fears;
Of her researches quite forgets
Of high desires and deep regret,
Of him had filled his simple youth,
Of his old uncle’s illness heard?
Of innocent felicity.
Of intimacies of the past.
Of jdowers, for our modest dwelling.
Of jealous pangs, and separation,
Of letters running to six pages.
Of life’s gay feast ere time is up,
Of life has perished like a flower 
Of loud farewells and crying maids;
Of lovely lady, modish sir.
Of loves that to the grave endure;
Of making such a choice, I know;
Of memory, or welcome rest,
Of my young friend I sing, and of
Of old the ballroom used to shake 
Of park and palace, dome and spire,
Of plates and silverware increases,
Of prejudice’s ancient yoke,
Of prudence now I drink Bordeaux.
Of quiet summer nights, how often,
Of seeing you by afternoon . . . .
Of seething hopes and giddy play,
Of silence he had lain at rest
Of snow, and wash her face and chest.
Of some attractive little thing.
Of some imported wild romance. 
Of speech to this insulting passion.
Of speech, and earn the mockery 
Of speech? For what malicious laughter 
Of such a manner, I’m pedantic.
Of syllables so musical 
Of that dread mystery, the grave;
Of that lost hour beneath the tree 
Of the Black Sea upon the shore.
Of the magnificent Neva.
Of the wild geese, a noisy clan;
Of this and that, to his distress;
Of this cold world, his soul would bless 
Of those he wished her to forget!
Of tulle she wore in other days;
Of welcome are indeed heart-rending.
Of what is common, what is grand;
Of what, in fashionable diction
Of which I’ve lost the habit now.
Of which Onegin never tired.
Of whom ’twas said throughout his span:
Of wintry pleasures; you will dote 
Of worldly scorn, and thus are fed.
Of youth renewed beside these streams.
Of youthful pranks and childish pleasures, 
Off in a narrow lane, at last.
Off in the cotmtry we can say
Off in the wilds — ^is it not true? — 
Off to the ball as is required,
Off to the country promptly packed her,
Offended vanity or spleen?
Oh, Brenta! I shall yet rejoice
Oh, I have erred sufficiently
Oh, Moscow, Moscow! I would view
Oh, empty world! Oh, stupid folk
Oh, horror! Better far to stay
Oh, humans, like your first mamma.
Oh, land of boundless fascination!
Oh, once again will you be singing
Oh, waters of the Adriatic!
Oh, yes. But there’s the whirl of fashion.
Old W’omen, boys with cheeks like cherries,
Old duelist can be malicious:
Old fogies all, chained to tradition,
Old monkeys of another age 
Old women smiled as she went by;
Old-fashioned hospitality.
Olenka too began to yawn,
Ombre and Boston claim the old,
On Apuleius gladly nourished.
On all but him! She never sees 
On balls I also used to dote:
On down to where the river flows.
On elegance her mind w^as bent.
On every single suitor’s hopes?
On everything and everyone:
On foreign scenes to feast our eyes;
On hearing this, Zaretzky started
On her loose hair, her tears, and on 
On horseback; such close friends were they 
On other paths, since youth is spent,
On past the bright parterre, the lawn.
On scenes both various and motley.
On sentiment we draw the curtain;
On stilts the bold pedestrian
On the bleak steppe go horseback-riding?
On the far bank the smoky fire
On the first page there’s this confection:
On the streaked ice the sunbeams play;
On themes to which none now alludes,
On through the field the girl will ride, 
On us the favors that men crave;
On whom shall we bestow affection,
On writing of another man.
On your protection till I die . . .
Once Vyazemsky sat down beside her
Once dwelt, two pines are intertwined —
Once free, and night will find me gloating
Once graced the devil’s own abode,
Once lechery that took its pleasure
Once more Tatyana’s heart is drumming;
Once more forsakes society.
One cherished fancy for another
One clownish fellow, idly leaning
One day when leading his battalion.
One finger’s frostbitten, of course.
One foot upon the floor is planted.
One has a cock’s head plain to see,
One heard the crickets’ slender choir.
One hears the clicking of a cock.
One is a horned and dog-faced creature,
One line, held in the memory.
One saw the cheerful morning smile;
One takes a risk in such discussion,
One thing alone he loved, he breathed;
One thing alone to think upon 
One thought must fill your heart with pain:
One who has lived and thought, grows scornful.
One whose embittered mind finds zest
One whose warm kindness has no end —
One window glimmers bright and rosy.
Onegin’s form, Onegin’s face.
Onegin’s holy life; unheeding,
Onegin’s letter A trick worthy of detestation;
Onegin’s portrait has been finished,
Onegin’s taste for books had vanished
Onegin’s traits with mine comparing —
Onegin’s waiting for us now.”
Onegin (I return to him).
Onegin a pure rapture felt.
Onegin comes, apologizing.
Onegin fires . . . oh, hapless men.
Onegin flies to taste the blisses
Onegin fumbles as he seeks 
Onegin grips his pistol tightly,
Onegin heard the sweet confession
Onegin leaned above the river
Onegin now decides he’ll cater
Onegin searched the cupboards, finding
Onegin sits and drinks a health,
Onegin sleeps and does not worry.
Onegin the cotillion. Lord!
Onegin too. '"^At last, oh, dear!”
Onegin took the letter to
Onegin turned to Lensky next:
Onegin was allowed to hear 
Onegin watches her, congealed:
Onegin without hesitating
Onegin, also far away.
Onegin, and I loved you; well? 
Onegin, but she seems to freeze 
Onegin, frozen with despair.
Onegin, like Childe Harold, scorning
Onegin, meet him, born and nourished
Onegin, need I ask you whether
Onegin, that familiar place.
Onegin, what shrewd line expressed 
Onegin, wiseacres aplenty

Orestes vied there with his friend,
Oton is so accommodating.
Our Lensky’s village, lives and thrives,
Our dapper coachmen are astounding,
Our freshest dreams grew sear, and scattered 
Our grandchildren evict us too.
Our hero took the marble stair,
Our hero, lived not so long since.
Our marriage w-ould mean misery.
Our native tongue turns up its nose
Our northern summer, swiftly flying,
Our songs, but are not worth the singing. 
Our sorrows and our smaller cares,
Our talkative young eremites;
Our time will come when it is due,
Our troikas tireless, forward bounding.
Out from the house the serf -boys fly,
Out of her swaddling-clothes, she’s fairly

Paid them the tribute of a sigh.
Pale nature shudders, tempest -tossed.
Pale valley and the silver stream;
Parks, pharmacies, Bohkarans, guards.
Parny’s sad tenderness is now
Past sentry-boxes now they dash,
Past shops and lamp-posts, serfs who lash
Past the Neva in a swift sleigh;
Past thick-ranked guests, aristocratic,

Perchance a humble lot awaited
Perchance he briefly knew the fever
Perchance he would have earned the wages

Perfumes in crystal cut with care;

Perhaps some lady may find matter

Perhaps what kept him was the mail,”
Perhaps, heeding the journals’ clamor.
Philosophers have calculated 
Place a proud vale at the end.
Plants cabbages like old Horatius,
Plucks at the ear-rings she is wearing,
Plump Pustyakov strides heavily;
Plunged into sadness beyond measure. 
Poets, it is my observation,
Points out my portrait unctuously.
Poor Lensky cannot bear his sorrow.
Poor Lensky fell . . . that luckless day.
Poor Lensky scarce knew what to say.
Poor Lensky! Olga’s heart was laden
Poor Lensky! Past the grave’s grim portal.
Poor Tanya’s youth is fading fast,
Poor Tanya, lighted by Diana,
Poor dreamer whom he sadly harried;
Pops; the wine fizzes; and Triquet,
Pores o’er a letter, in seclusion;
Portraying happy love for you;

Pursued in flight by flaming glances;
Pursued with so much elegance;
Pushkin’s day.
Pushkin discarded, see Note to Chapter VI, Stanza
Pushkin occasionally omitted one or more stanzas, or 
Pushkin provided the novel with a number of notes,
Pussy is what the girls prefer.
Pyotr Vyazemsky, a minor author and brilliant con- 
Quit of the shore’s dull element?
Quite free of all his debts at fifty.
Quite withered now in very truth?
Quote Virgil, not a long selection.
Racine or Virgil, Walter Scott,
Raise doubts that leave his heart perplexed,
Rapt eloquence in speech and song.
Recall Dmitriyev’s castigation;
Recall with pain the vanished boon:
Recalling in the soft sweet air
Reciting all their hopes with candor,
Recovered, Tanya, pale and shrinking,
Refuse to let you sleep a wink;
Regards. But Olga, oh, my friend, \ ou 
Regent’s army; he returned to Russia with a split 
Relating with romantic art
Released j&:om the damp cork, the bottle
Remained his friends, I grant you this.
Remarks the jew^els and the laces,
Remembering the past, perforce 
Remind him of a face forgot.
Renowned, resplendent, diplomatic.
Repeatedly and almost grimly 
Replied as though he little cared 
Reply, Bakhchi-Sarai’s sad fountain!
Reread I cannot ... I must end . . .
Responded: "Why should we delay?”
Responding to his hasty ringing.
Rests on the smoky streams, and he 
Revealing to their haughty gaze
Reveals herself in every scene;
Reveillez-vous^ belle endormie.
Revenge approaches, so, concealing
Revenge was something of a pleasure,
Reviews the past in wistful fashion:
Revived the grandeur of Corneille;
Rich empty rooms Onegin came 
Ripe daughters, dressed in last year’s fashions. 
Rolled by in peace; sometimes the neighbors
Romancer, having settled on 
Romances, upon every page 
Round old Moet or Veuve Cliquot; 
Roused at her wonted hour from rest,
Rousseau (forgive me if I chatter)
Runs smoothly as a hackneyed song.
Runs to the poor youth lying there.
SPEAK ILL OF MOSCOW! THERE’s YOUR TRAVELER!
STILL FOR EVER FARE THEE WELL.
Sacred to scions of Apollo!
Sad murmur of the soul’s complaint.
Sad murmurs filled the woodland ways
Safe in the woodland, hid away.
Sang for the guests across the wine,
Save for the chorus on the hill
Say who it is that now the Spanish 
Say, from a bullet-wound? Or failing.
Say, now, my friend, what will you feel
Says ’yes’ and ’no,’ but never ’sir.’ ”
Says Tanya, ^'Nay, I am not grumbling:
Scarce breathing, making no replies,
Schiller, of course, by candle-light.
Scrawled over by her friends at leisure
Screws up his eye and is preparing
Search Russia through, you’ll scarce discover
Second: the poet was a fool.
Secure a tryst with tender art,
Sed alia temporal Such jolly
Seduce you, though the cost be frightful. 
Seduction ceased to be amusing,
Seeing the molten wax assume
Seeks omens in the song they sing;
Seemed sunk in gloom, or bold and free.
Self-centered and indifferent.
Semyon Petrovich is as mean.
Semyonova there wrought her magic 
Set huckleberry syrup out.
Shall I be thirty presently?
Shall I depict less with a prudent
Shall greet you. Go, my dear creation:
Shall know the secrets of the grave,
She’d watch its flight with anxious eye.
She’s at the window — always she! . . .
She’s wearing raspberry.” "Yes, you
She asks: ”The left? What’s there to see?”
She at a table took her place
She bade me hear the waters sing,
She breathes again and yet again,
She can no more, her strength is gone*
She cannot. No? But why? She’s given
She chides the waters that impede her^
She clambered up a hill, commanding
She conned the talk against her will;
She could but peak and pine and weep,
She cries: ^'Whom, Tanya, did you see?”
She dare not lift, for shame and fear.
She did not speak the language well
She did the overseeing; cool
She does not argue: by delaying
She does not breathe, she does not stir;
She does not heed: and sore it grieves him
She does not raise him, leaves him kneeling;
She does not sniff the cold, or run
She dreams. And wonders are appearing
She drops her handkerchief, and shivers,
She falls . . .
She falls into the snow; alertly
She fancied ghosts behind her stalking.
She fears the dream bodes only ill.
She finds; abyss, ape, bear, bridge, cave,
She flies, a thing of down, enchanted;
She flies, she flies, nor in her flight 
She followed, as he did, the fashion;
She found in a romantic story
She found the margins most appealing:
She gazes at him without pause . . .
She glances at the road, distressed.
She glides; and now serenely stops,
She had not read with fascination
She halted at the gate-way, telling
She halted, like one scorched by fire. 
She has no aim, no occupation.
She has no trace of coquetry —
She hates their having come at all.
She hears and does not hear the closing
She hears it all at every visit.
She hears the raucous laughter swell 
She hurries, but the dreadful shape
She is alone, alack-a-day!
She is not hurried, is not chilly,
She knew, I wonder how. I fear
She knows her role! With none to thank — 
She lacked her sister’s charm, and wanted
She lacks the look of snobbishness,
She lies as though she has not heard,
She lies for hours, with sleep uncertain;
She likes the talk of haughty sages
She looks about in puzzled sort.
She looks about, with heart that flutters:
She looks at him in some dismay.
She looks on nothing with delight.
She looks, half soothed and half excited,
She lost her Frenchy airs and graces;
She loves an uhlan with devotion . . .
She loves him still; and in remorse,
She loves the secrets that environ 
She might return; yes, if permitted. 
She must accept at last, I thought.
She noted, trembling and excited.
She pickled mushrooms with her cooks;
She pinched her waist with tightened laces,
She puzzles till she is distracted,
She quaked at omens; all around her
She reads the sweet romance, and how
She rises as the morning flushes
She runs, he follows on and on;
She said "Akulka” for Celine;
She searches for a passage showing
She seemed a stranger to her own.
She seems the image quite perfected
She sees . . . Why, who would credit it? 
She sees a court she does not know,
She shared our banquets, crowned our joys —
She should go home, where guests are waiting
She shuddered, mute; her lovely eyes
She sighs, she pines both day and night!
She sits with an untroubled air.
She sits with downcast head, too lax
She sought the path, but as she turned, 
She speaks to them as to old friends.
She stands, suffused with shy emotion.
She stifles here . . . her heart is sore.
She suffocates; she scarcely hears
She then, as love has power to do,
She thinks, uncertain, and goes on.
She thumbed her Martin till he knew
She too at length came forth, and nigh 
She trembles like a hunted fawn;
She waits: when will the answer come? 
She walks ahead. The old crone mutters:
She wanders with imagined lovers
She was affianced, but her mother
She was no beauty: that were fiction
She was not one of those who glories
She went. Onegin stood forsaken,
She whispered to herself: ’Tis he!
She will not find her meadows there.
She will not see him, the betrayer;
She would go stumbling down the road.
She would not win you by her face,
Shed rainbow lights across the snow
Shines the resplendent southern sun —
Shorter and shorter grew the days;
Should I not give the letter’s text 
Should cross her path while she was walking, 
Should giddy deity desire
Should howl absurdly: ^It is I!”
Should see how lovely she has grown!
Shouts bravo in his sleep, and then
Show off their impudence, their vests.,
Show rapture or indifference,
Showed him so cold and calm a brow?
Shows passion’s volatility?
Shy as the doe who runs alone.
Simplicity to her young dream?
Since Latin’s held not worth attention,
Since but a random education
Since infancy her only pleasure
Since the dead days of Romulus.
Since time, without my interference,
Since you were christened? Gracious sakes!
Sing a song, a happy song.
Sing and bring a dashing lad
Singer of feasts and tender sorrow,
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Sits down; the game is done — ^he goes;
Sits home, awaiting the reply;
Slapped servant-girls who were unpleasant;
Sleepless, Tatyana would converse 
Slight errors have a choice effect.
Slow eyes come last to rest upon 
Smooth aria, the eager plea.
So Eugene preached and Tanya listened,
So Heaven wills it. Your young soul 
So Tanya bit by bit is learning
So be it! Now my destiny
So be it; but I had to speak;
So countrified, a bit dejected,
So different, first they bored each other.
So easily, with passion seethed;
So elegantly can devise 
So exquisite as sacrifice;
So fortune-telling’s not for us.
So he returned, took Chatzky’s cue.
So pious are they, so precise.
So to their destination straightway
So turning morning into night,
Soft glance, nor welcome sweetly caroled.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Some charming spot to hold her still.
Some clue the index may afford her. 
Some dunce may yet pronounce as he 
Some fragment of his Northern art.
Some pages held a sharp incentive
Some, honor’s victims, scarred by war,
Some, prey to piles, or Aphrodite;
Something more certain to amuse.
Sometimes he reads to Olga, trying
Soon found a way to soothe her pain;
Soon the dry valleys will be blooming;
Soon, soon my soul will not remember: 
Sounding the cry that all was well;
Spoke of divorce in her despair.
Spring calls you to the verdant soil.

Stares out upon the shadowed lea:
Stay indoors, by a book befriended?
Steel files and combs of various guises,
Steep cliffs above the ocean’s purl,
Stifled, in solitude, unknown.
Still clings to hope, though it be slender.
Still half asleep, nature is meeting
Stood like a threatening apparition;
Stood thunderstruck. He could not stir.
Storm-giver Zeus decrees Odessa
Straight past the porter, like an arrow
Straight to the stranger Tanya speeds,
Strange Jean Sbogar enchants her too.
Strange faces mid the painted set.
Strange woes that left me broken-hearted . . .
Stuff that the Flemish school would draw.
Submissive through the grave’s dark portal. 
Such are the bard’s gratifications;
Such as the Muse alone can bring;
Such bliss is transient, if absurd;
Such faithful friendship as my hero’s
Such feelings in this troubled heart,
Such is the guerdon of your daring!
Such is the news he’s eager for.
Such people with each day grow duller.
Such shoulders I have never known!
Such stuff as Lafontaine has written . . .
Such treachery who could forget?
Such vulgar scenes as these despising.
Suppose your pistol-shot has ended
Surly and languid as Childe Harold.
Surprise, asks: ''Where’s your second, pray?”
Surrendered his inheritance;
Surveying fallow land and plowed.
Suspicious age could do no less,
Sweet Lei now hovers o’er her head.
THEN ONEGIN VISITS TAURIS:
THOU, MY SWEET SVETLANA.
TO ONEGIN
TO ONEGIN But you^re unsociable, they say.
TO ONEGIN Dispel my doubts! My mind^s awhirl;
TO TATYANA
TO TATYANA Already your reproach I hear.
Take off, and smoothly soar away.
Take rest, young poet, as thy wage.”
Take what is offered of delight.
Talon’s Ms goal, no hesitating:
Tanya’s the center of attraction.
Tanya prepared for fortune- telling
Tanya surveys it with a start.
Tanya with simple faith defended
Tanya, her silken belt untying,
Tanya, my dear, your looks distress me.”
Tanya, though she could give no reason,
Tatyana’s
Tatyana’s — comes next Saturday.
Tatyana’s bloom is all but faded;
Tatyana’s brilliant catch discerning,
Tatyana’s husband is appearing.
Tatyana’s letter For days^ until another meeting.
Tatyana’s letter Or but a tempter to undo me?
Tatyana’s letter lies before me,
Tatyana’s match was ail the rumor;
Tatyana’s solitude adds fuel
Tatyana’s trouble; but each eye 
Tatyana burned and shivered, asking:
Tatyana cannot but be grateful
Tatyana cannot stop her tears.
Tatyana does, expecting that the mirror will reflect 
Tatyana fills his every thought;
Tatyana goes, impelled by love.
Tatyana had no doll at all
Tatyana hears the chorus sounding,
Tatyana in the court appears,
Tatyana is alone; but making 
Tatyana leaps like nothing mortal 
Tatyana like a child surrenders 
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana looked as though she heard 
Tatyana might be found romancing
Tatyana moans, and as she shivers
Tatyana read no Russian journal.
Tatyana scanned them without fail.
Tatyana sets the door ajar . . .
Tatyana should be settled, too.
Tatyana shows no sign of caring
Tatyana stares in fascination,
Tatyana thrills with pain and pleasure
Tatyana took her silent way
Tatyana trembled and grew red. 
Tatyana was her name then — granted.
Tatyana was her sister’s name:
Tatyana watched them drive away 
Tatyana, and with failing breath.
Tatyana, breathless, caimot stir;
Tatyana, dear Tatyana! Weeping,
Tatyana, dreaming, walked alone.
Tatyana, spell-bound, lingers still.
Tatyana, still an early riser,
Tatyana, terror-struck, is waking . . »
Tatyana, the society lady, is unexplained and too 
Tatyana, who spoke each one fair;
Tell fortunes, too, but otherwise:
Term vulgar. To my great dismay,
Than anything that I could do —
Than face them; he who has gone through it
Than halt bewildered on the shore.
Than in the north Aurora’s blushes.
Than is the moon one sees at dawn;
Than other men are doomed to feel:
Than that you sought, poor innocent. 
Than this: a household where the wife 
Than with a quite impartial pen 
That’s fine, but if the truth were told.
That’s where the eligibles are!”
That Hymen brings, the grief and pain, 
That I am feeling far from strong; 
That I am not Onegin’s sort;
That I had stained my reputation — 
That I should meet you. God on High 
That I should see you once a week 
That Ovid sang, that brought him here, 
That ancient glory still shines bright . ,
That ardent and most charming letter?
That argues a resourceful poet,
That at Very’s on credit he 
That bodes full flowers and honeyed fruit. 
That burdened my Tatyana’s heart! 
That by a sudden storm was drenched;
That could not very well be worse.
That day would soon be on the march.
That does not frighten anyone
That even thirteen-year-old misses
That fine parquet can never muster.
That forms the ducklings’ paradise.
That have come down the years to us 
That he must have a change of scene
That he, when wheels were within hearing,
That here, for all the world to know it,
That huckleberry syrup will,
That ladies’ feet have had for me.
That little girl ... is it a dream?
That little girl he did not deem
That man alone knows blessedness 
That miracles could be achieved.
That morning, gay and debonair.
That my performance is infernal,
That natiure’s season of renewal 
That no hope of renewal cheers?
That one be potted anyhow,
That only mediocrity 
That only once in a great while.
That our bright pristine hopes grew battered,
That poetry is their affair.
That poets feel, he lacked, nor knew 
That poets owe imto the Muse,
That poor Tatyana was upset.
That riots through the mountain passes;
That scarce had heard of his existence, 
That she’s ideal — he must jot 
That she should offer a narration 
That shows a statuette of iron:
That silently you spoke to me.
That silly moon you see there looming.”
That teeth and nails may both be served.
That the first strophes should be read 
That thrilled him in the days gone by,
That time and change may not erase.
That to such matters Homer pays.
That trembles with another’s passion; 
That waters well the nearby valley.
That we are driving in the dark.
That will not be ten times repeated
That write he must, and in this fashion — 
That year was extraordinary.
That you should scorn me, or ignore.
That youth was given us in vain,
The Academic lexicon.
The British Muse’s wild invention
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew; 
The English spleen it may resemble,
The Hindu — diamonds in his coffer;
The Horse Guard’s spurs clank as he dances;
The Kalmucks’ flocks, contented, graze. 
The Moscow belies are many, too.
The Muse — to marriage been converted.
The Muse first shone before my eyes.
The Muse has come, and love departed,
The Nereids’ low murmuring.
The Russian envoy rescued him and sent hi m as a 
The Vampire wrecks her sleep at night;
The afternoon of life is starting,
The aged, at the grave’s grim portal.
The album and the corset vanished,
The album of a country miss,
The arms are crossed — a well-known pose —
The aunts, of one thing only thinking.
The autumn seemed so loth to go;
The baker’s German and precise.
The baker’s wicket opens out,
The balcony where such a press is,
The ball’s wild gaiety was wearing.
The ball had pierced clean through the breast.
The ball-room summons one and all.
The ballroom’s ruler, scarcely human.
The bank; one hears a gentle spring;
The bear is marching at her heels.
The bear says: '^Here my gossip dwells.
The bearded old postilion’s mounted —
The beau monde*s burdensome conventions
The bed-curtains; awake completely,
The bee deserts her waxen cell
The beefsteak and the Strasbourg patty 
The bench where the old nurse was seated 
The billows covered them with kisses,
The billows, while the shrouds are rattling, 
The blithest dawn in sullen clouds.
The blood that burns tmth frantic fire;
The blow of a malignant fate.
The boa on her shoulders, and 
The bold hihitka swiftly traces
The bony hands, the sly grimaces;
The boredom: nabbing the unwary
The box, where, regnant in her splendor.
The breath of life would then infuse.
The bud that just begins to blow.
The bullets are crammed down already;
The cab, to spare the feeble nag.
The call of fame, for you forgot 
The call to early labors dinning;
The carriage horses, chilled with waiting.
The cattle low; the nightingale
The chairs shoved backward scrape the flooring;
The chance to read his modest songs 
The charming and ingenuous maid
The charming lad was rather wild.
The cheerful morning sounds awaken;
The child of shrewdness and of daring,
The child while still at play prepares
The children learn their A-B-C.
The chilly dark the girl is sharing
The city breathes of Europe; hotly.
The city soon will wear resounding
The classic trumpet, sword, and mask; 
The clouds before him — can it be?
The coachmen round the bonfires tramp.
The cold pretensions to success.
The colonel’s sending it. A ball!
The columns of the city gate
The company commander, whom 
The company could see no harm
The comrade upon whom she doted.
The contemplative dryads played.
The cordial words: 'There was a poet!” 
The cost of post-horses, was glad 
The coughs, the shouts and hisses sounding.
The country life, the rustic hovels.
The country round about was still,
The country to the past is tender.
The country, and its dulness, bore you;
The couple stood, to say good-bye.
The couples as they whirl aw*ay,
The couples to the table swarm;
The courtyard white, a white parterre,
The creature bellows in reply 
The creatures fancy animated;
The creditors began to gather,
The crooked trunks, the gleaming claw^s.
The crowd of house-sprites, blowing out 
The crowd whose sparkle nothing dims,
The crowd, the hubbub, and the glitter!
The cruel fates have surely not 
The crunch of snow . , « a step approaches;
The curtain rustles as it soars;
The customs that our elders knew.
The dale is dark and vapor-ridden.
The darkened mind is clear again; 
The darling object was provided
The dawn shines ruddy; Olga rushes 
The day is done: he’s not replying,
The day my father gave his blessing;
The day of busy cares is blessed.
The day to come, what is it bearing?
The day upon which they intended
The day was set, his heart elated;
The days speed by; before you know it
The dazzling capital, forgot —
The dead man buried, they were able
The dedication is addressed to Pyotr Alexandro-
The dining-room: on chairs they slumber. 
The dogs attack her, all but biting
The dolts that must be tolerated.
The door swings wide, and Lensky’s here,
The double windows, the snug fire;
The dread of vice, the fear of shame.
The dreaded one, the dearly prized:
The dream alarms her, and not knowing
The dream pervades her mournful moods.
The driver on his box we note
The drum is heard, the city’s rousing,
The editor has followed closely the text of the first
The end of the mazurka, and 
The enemies their mantles doff.
The errors are a trifle merely.
The exile from society
The eyeglass of the connoisseur.
The eyes of the ingenuous young;
The faces one meets everywhere;
The fair ones, whom you were addressing 
The fair young pilgrim must go home.
The faithful one is soon affected:
The family is well; they send you
The fashion of a bygone day:
The fatal hour is past recall;
The father’s simple words repeating.
The fathers, indeed all, could see
The fear, the shame, are past endurance . . .
The fearful bill, unheeded, mounts.
The feast goes on, but soon thereafter
The feast he was quite unprepared for, 
The feast makes every move a labor.
The feasts where wealth and wit were squandered,
The few who relish toil and teen).
The fields’ and forests’ solitude
The fields with droplets once again), 
The fierce flames reddening the skies.
The fiery glance, he could but find
The fine keen wit of yesteryear 
The fire is out; the ashes, shifting,
The first clear picture is disclosing
The first gay snowflakes spin once more
The first shy rays begin to gleam;
The flash of wit, the flouncing dress.
The floor is oak; two chests, a table,
The flower of life that blooms but once.
The flying hours no one counts.
The foes stood by, with downcast eyes.
The foes! How long had they been parted
The folly of a simple girl:
The foreign tongue is native to
The friend of wintry cottage nights.
The friends, without delaying,
The frightened maiden gathers strength
The frost-work o’er the panes was twining;
The frosts begin to snap, and gleaming
The frozen corpse Zaretzky places.
The frozen funds of intellection —
The furnishings are plain and stable.
The gallants for their hostess vying.
The gamblers, worthy men and bold:
The game he can at last forget;
The gathering, affected by it
The general, since such tributes flatter 
The gentry all cried out in scorn,
The gifts the newcomer possessed;
The girl, stands rooted to the spot*
The girlish secrets of the heart,
The girls with Olga and Tatyana
The girls, off by themselves, conspire;
The glitter of the noisy press.
The glories of these frosty days.
The glory’s gone, I know not why;
The goal is there before them. Blazing
The golden bubbles rising lightly
The golden tongue Italians speak;
The good wdfe took her husband’s measure. 
The gossips ever are malicious,
The grandfathers it promptly urges.
The grove’s asleep. The wind blows chill.
The grove, the bridge, the lake, and on.
The guests’ sly glances were enough.
The guests are early in arriving.
The guests are greeted with delight;
The guests, arriving, hear their laughter. 
The hall is packed to suffocation,
The hallowed letters O and E.
The hammers on the ramrods knock;
The happiness of youth must pass.
The happy man who took no chance
The harbor is a busy sight;
The hat is cocked, the brow morose.
The haughty creatures may inspire
The haughty portrait of Lord Byron,
The hazy dawn commences coldly.
The heart of the confirmed coquette!
The heart once more with hope will glow.
The heart recalls its ancient scars,
The heart that thought its fires had dwindled
The heart with virgin tenderness?
The hearth breathes warmth, and all’s serene;
The hearts of both now spurned the flame
The heavens glow with azure light.
The helpless girl can do no more
The herd no longer drives his cattle,
The hero’s named, the work’s begun;
The hero we’re intent upon.
The highroad, leveled altogether,
The hoar-frost in the sun a -shimmer.
The hope on which my heart is fed?
The hopeful youth was quick to find 
The horns and hoofs, the whiskered faces,
The horse who scents him snorts and quivers,
The horses scent the dead, and foam
The horses to an oak near by.
The hostess cries. Guests squeeze together,
The hot fat cutlets; you would say 
The hour called ^^entre chien et loup^^^
The hour for waking and for sleeping;
The hours allotted me by Fate,
The hours go by: they do not waken;
The house hummed like a hive of bees
The house rocks with applause; undaunted,
The housekeeper a slow good-bye;
The husband enters: the appalling
The icy river shows a luster
The idol of all maids in bloom.
The image trembling in the glass
The imps and cupids, quick as monkeys,
The insults time heaps on her head 
The jagged flint still harmless, lifted.
The jesting mixed with flattery . . .
The joys they knew have all proved mortal.
The kindly fates had fancied me.
The ladies’ little feet fly by.
The ladies all pressed closer to her;
The ladies enter; now it’s gliding 
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The ladies, each a picture when
The lady’s lasting admiration
The lady of the house: she’s fled —
The land that knew my love, my pain, 
The landed gentleman has brought 
The language of the gods rejected . . .
The languor and the flame of love 
The languors of a distant day.
The last chapter of Eugene Onegin was published
The law of Fate is ever just.
The lazy Orient longer dozes.
The leaps, the heels, the whiskers fair. 
The less we love her, sooth to say —
The letter’s ready to be sent;
The letter shakes; she heaves a sigh;
The letter to you quite intact.
The letters that he wrote so neatly,
The lies that journals perpetrate,
The lifting mist reveals the pleasant
The lighted stage, and with a yawn 
The lights, bewildering the rout;
The lily -stem, and withers so
The little feet and lovely limbs;
The little tricks that are affected
The lively Muse was at my side
The loads on the kibitkas sway.
The local Paris: Petushkov,
The lofty madcap! — but no matter:
The lofty passion, the pure pleasure
The lonely gloom was hard to bear.
The lonely thicket where a stream
The loss of it I could not bear.
The loud finale sounds, and pushing,
The lovelorn boy ignored them quite.
The lovely ladies’ filmy dresses.
The lover’s language, the sweet vow,
The lustrous tea-cups, never spilling 
The magazines that like to scold
The magic of the bow obeying,
The maiden lies there, pale as death.
The maids and coachmen vie in swearing; 
The maids would gleefully foretell 
The man? Or vanity, forsooth?
The mansion j&rom its firm foundation
The mansion, hy a hill well hidden,
The marker on the balcony
The marriage-broker kept on pressing
The married rakes, no longer naughty.
The masses of your mountains gleamed,
The master had no need to scold
The masters of the berry -crop.
The matchless bore — on these she mused; 
The matter for a fortnight; oh.
The maxims her mamma has taught.
The meadows’ solitary look,
The menu hangs there, in plain sight.
The merchant’s wife, so young and slender. 
The merchant, to the port is faring 
The merry and monotonous round.
The messenger was not kept waiting:
The mind’s reflections coldly noted,
The modern Russian’s worst disease.
The moment that I saw you coming,
The mooB’s enchantment so obsessed her.
The moon has risen; in a light 
The moon her magic vigil kept.
The moon is fading with the night;
The moon, the lampion of heaven.
The most congenial of men.
The mother fell to figuring
The mother groans. "It drives me wild;
The mountain maid, untamed, inspiring,
The music, he would whisper low 
The mystic, wistful hours of night;
The naked woods surprise the sight,
The name-day feast is soon begun.
The nasal twang she also banished.
The neighbor now declares: ''He’s killed.”
The neighbors’ heads and tongues are wagging:
The neighbors promptly called and twaddled
The neighbors, pleasantly diverted,
The newcomers but ape the old;
The news gives Tanya little pleasure.
The nightingale’s keen melodies
The nightingale, this season’s lover,
The noble taste of bygone days.
The noise is queer and terrifying.
The north wind breathes and bellows, driving
The noses blown, and without pause.
The novelist had long since won;
The nurse alone might well have guessed,
The nurse replied: "God save you, daughter!”
The old assessor, paralytic?
The old fat counsellor, Flyanov,
The old gray nurse thinks she is napping
The old man had no time to look
The olden sorrows I regret.
The opera summons — in a word,
The orchestra’s already drooping;
The other day in rainy weather
The other slowly circles, thus,
The ox with lowered horns must drag
The oysters? They have come! In rapture
The page he read could scarcely bore him.
The pail is brought, the ice is clinking
The painful dream forever broken!
The pair of us had planned to wander,
The parlor’s crowded; barking pugs,
The parlor hums with conversation,
The passer-by may read it clear:
The passions, though, concerned more often
The pattern of a paragon.
The peddler plods, the merchant dresses,
The pen makes mock of such as he.
The pencil-marks he made with care
The people’s lore of days gone by;
The perishable human crop.
The phrasing, awkward or mistaken,
The pile of books no longer read,
The pines, their boughs on every hand 
The pistols gleam, held straight and steady;
The placid course of rustic leisure;
The plain girl’s love? Why, even now,
The plan I had no pains to settle,
The plans to have been consummated,
The pleasures relished, triumphs thwarted;
The poet’s ardent speech, the mind
The poet’s earliest elation
The poet did not think of stopping
The poet in his exaltation
The poet in the very dawn
The poet is no more ... his lot
The poet lets his pistol fall.
The poet, and he may, forsooth,
The poet, and the world will follow 
The poet, swift in thought and action,
The poet, with impatience burning.
The poisonous vUe worm that mumbles
The polite ”yes” that is behooving.
The poor girl stands there, almost senseless;
The poor old lady, broken-hearted.
The poor shy girl whose adoration
The poor thing nearly swoons; she’s ill.
The pranks and jokes of former years.
The press is thick, the hubbub loud.
The prima donna? The ballet?
The prince’s comrade and relation 
The prince invites him to be present 
The princess, and her feeble cries 
The princess, pale, in neglige.
The prisoned girls of the Salgir,
The profile that a move will blur
The promise of her spring was blighted,
The proud lorgnettes the ladies hold
The purling of a gentle brook;
The quarrel grows; Onegin quickly
The queen, aloof, remote, imperious.
The race of men recks nothing, save
The rain of passion is not cruel.
The rapids and the underbrush
The reason doesn’t really matter.)
The relatives — and there are dozens —
The rings are plucked; each maiden, sighing, 
The rings that the new mode dictated.
The river and its banks are leveled;
The road is lost and past divining.
The rogue, who somehow would escape 
The roofs, the fence, all molded fair;
The room grows loud with talk and laughter, 
The room where the old man berated
The room, though not without a sigh.
The rooms are thronged and hot and gay.
The rosy dawn brings forth the sun,
The rustic cyclop labors, daft,
The ruts and ditches that abound
The same consuming agony.
The samovar, that blest invention,
The saucers of preserve about.
The scene where first I saw your face,
The science of the tender passion
The sea, the southern sun for basking . . .
The secret shame with which I burned^
The secret she will never mention,
The secrets of the nuptial bed;
The senses soon grew blunt and dull.
The servants gather at the gates 
The servants gave him all assistance,
The sex, of course, is light as do’^m.
The shades of night are growing thinner.
The shadows creep across the sill.
The shaggy monster seizes her,
The sharks who feed on gamblers’ passions
The shepherd’s horn awakes the peasant;
The shutters closed, the windows blear
The shutters open; chimneys spout;
The sight of them produces spleen.
The sign with shaking hand, she prayed.
The silence at long last is broken
The silent fields, abandoned, wait,
The silent stars, the brooding moon —
The simple girl whose dreams, whose ways.
The simple lines there graven, she 
The simple talk flows readily.
The sky breathed autumn, somber, shrouded;
The sledge awaits. He does not tarry:
The sleepless fellow’s heart and head.
The sly thrall struggle to be free.
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The snow is reaching to her knee;
The snows still gleaming softly pink,
The soul so shy of happiness;
The sound of Russian when correct;
The sounding waves’ eternal chorus,
The source of tears and happiness.
The spirit of an oddish dreamer.
The splendid mansion shines and gleams, 
The spot itself was God-forsaken.
The square grows lively now and dizzy
The stalls are seething, the pit roars,
The stars of night are fair and many,
The state relied, his friends were told. 
The steward came here when requested;
The storm and strife, the frequent feast; 
The storms which shook it like a leaf
The stove with colored tiles, appealing
The strains of Albion’s proud lyre 
The strait-laced innocent beguile 
The stranger. At her frightened cry,
The street-lamps’ pallid substitute.
The subject of an argmnent?
The subject, give me your attention:
The sudden soimd of hoofs! . . . She freezes.
The sun appears, a brief snow-flurry
The table shone with wax; they handed
The tails and tusks and bloody jaws.
The talk is seasoned well thereafter 
The talk would turn with strange persistence
The tea. I note the hour, or nearly,
The tender feelings and the brave?
The tender leaves, but in the spring 
The tender torments, and the sadness, 
The tender verse. Princess Pauline;
The terraced scene, the view unfolding 
The theatre’s full, the boxes glitter,
The theatre’s wicked legislator.
The theme from which he ne’er departed
The thing that makes the world go round.
The things that I concoct in lonely
The third day interest abated
The thirst for knowledge, toil, and fame.
The thoughts of youth so high and grave.
The three kibitkas customary
The throng with a mute eye commanding?
The time came when he quite abhorred
The time had come — she was in love.
The time of tempting nights approaches,
The time run on, and in the middle
The times improve, and better us!
The tinsel of unwelcome days,
The tom-cat calls the tabby
The tone the gentlemen employed,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The touching glasses chime and clink.
The trace you left has long since perished
The traveler observes and shivers 
The tread of passion augurs tears:
The treasure none can ever guess,
The trees in wintry silver gleamed;
The truest source of inspiration:
The truth, and, God be praised, can see 
The tune, however, threatens her;
The tw"o explore the garden’s charm.
The two Skotinins, gray as sages.
The two friends’ greetings; and the tears 
The two old women weep, embrace.
The unconcerned beloved anew.
The vapor wreathes the china pot.
The verses came — but who would know it? —
The version of it given here 
The very boon they would petition,
The very hero of our novel!
The very words Onegin wrote.
The view into the moonlit night.
The village, where Onegin’s leisure
The vintage of the comet flows.
The vision of a peerless girl,
The vista of a free romance!
The voice of mistress, foe, and friend,
The volumes at long last succeeding 
The war, the snow-fall, and his mate.
The waters, where they boil and toss;
The way a Russian verse is turned.
The weak would mend life’s fraying thread;
The well-known clubman, who, God bless us, 
The while Zaretzky with a sneer
The while she howls both long and loud;
The while we hear the woodland sing?
The whist -players are Hon-hearted:
The whole day through in solitude.
The will to rule is seen thus early:
The wind, would enter, gently warning
The window, where he read it through.
The wit Triquet, late of Tambov.
The wolf beside his hungry mate.
The women mowing oft repair
The woods, Tatyana stayed at home,
The word is one I can’t translate:
The words again with stifled moan.
The world’s oblivious animation.
The world of glory thus bereaving,
The world without, Tatyana crept.
The world would gain if it should learn 
The world, the ball, are both forgot,
The wretched story out, complete —
The year’s bright dawn with gentle greeting.
The years to rugged prose constrain me.
The young Othello is delighted!
The young and hopeful brides-to-be,
The young tell fortimes, all are jolly.
The younger beauties will declare
The youth was called on every hand
The youthful heart; I will defy
Their arms about each other, creep 
Their conquests and their pranks with glee;
Their daughters, after due embraces.
Their endlessly protracted caU.
Their freezing glances framed to hurt you.
Their gestmes marked by firm decision,
Their judgment both men freely gave.
Their looks enchant, their words are sweet, 
Their love, though tempests fill the air.
Their mark the temple or the thigh.
Their marriage was a certainty.
Their masters wearily berating.
Their meetings passed; in turn they spoke
Their monocles that rake the guests.
Their nags, huts, mansions, monasteries,
Their news, their gossip — all arc stale.
Their pangs, and he, remote from love,
Their rapid bubbles hissing still;
Their steaming cups have barely stirred 
Their very slander has no color;
Their voices, and their words were kind, 
Them both aside and only for a 
Themselves to find out his intent.
Then I required, as I protested,
Then Olga’s suitor paid a visit.
Then all is changed. For lo! she veers,
Then at the rug that decks the bed,
Then buzzing, all sit down to dine.
Then dipped into some vile review.
Then disappointed beyond measure, 
Then fell again to talking of
Then flash with pride and flame with anger, 
Then he came up to her and said: 
Then he presents the madrigal.
Then he suggests they sit one out.
Then let each man be on his mettle:
Then liking grew: they met each day
Then plunged into domestic labors:
Then they demand in compensation
Then wafted as by Eolus
Then what a poem I’ll contrive 
Then you will weep, but who supposes
Then, aiming at his pallid brow.
Then, at a party he attends
Then, hurry, hurry to the fields!
Then, in the flower of his youth?
Then, with a look that showed her tiring,
Theocritus and Homer bored him ;
There’s gloom and darkness all about;
There’s little here that’s exquisite.
There Shakovskoy brought noisy laughter
There a Circassian’s horse goes flying;
There are no inns. In a cold cottage
There at her feet, as they would do.
There bold Fonvizin, freedom’s friend,
There is a dinner-party daily
There is a quickening at the root
There is a roaring in her ears . . .
There is no answer to his letter;
There is no calumny so deep.
There is no notion so erratic.
There is no sleep for such as she.
There is no sparkle here of wit;
There is the spot if you would know it:
There may the lyre sound clear and free,
There one can make a declaration,
There pours in torrents from his pen 
There sings all night; wild roses cover
There the Petrovsky Palace, hiding
There was a time when the impassioned
There was a time when the portrayal
There, when the tardy moon was shining. 
There, wistful-eyed, behold her stand,
Thereby our eighteen-year -old sage.
Therewith a bottle of light wine,
These artless lines can never bore me.
These friends! ’tw^as not for nothing that 
These guests, and somehow keeps her seat.
These many years, to me, or you.
These proud reflections all portend:
These spoke to her with silent force.
These warnings in your ears are dinned 
These were the secret fond traditions
They’d come to an old aunt, now failing —
They’d sup, then time for sleep drew nigh.
They’ll cock the trigger and let fly,
They’re duller than the things we write.
They’ve played eight rubbers at a stretch.
They are so clever, so serene.
They bark and whistle, sing and screech. 
They came into my mind so pat.
They chase the dogs away, alert
They chew. The pleasant prandial chink
They chortle, argue, shout and squeak.
They climg as brother clings to brother.
They come, they conquer, and they flee.
They come. Quite unaffected still.
They cross themselves, their heads incline,
They dared not let their voices drop:
They do not change, depend upon it.
They eye our heroine askance.
They face Tatyana, who is paler
They find her odd — so unaffected.
They gallop snorting o’er the snow.
They glow, they burn, the ecstasies
They gossiped on, in high good humor.
They had to travel for a week.
They hitch them to the master’s sleigh; 
They learned, and we, before we leave.
They like to fill a man with fear.
They liked to tread a country measure;
They look like fenceposts, flashing by.
They loosed my braids, and singing low
They loved the good old ways, and wallowed
They married her sans her consent.
They met; except that both were human.
They only sent him off to sleep.
They rouse are those of youthful kisses, 
They say that life does not afford
They say the ladies should read Russian,
They set a table laid for two;
They settled dowm on his estate.
They sought to make love’s ties more binding 
They still can thrill me in my dreams.
They stop because the servants fetch 
They take her to the Club for dances.
They too were of their duties heedful,
They took communion twice a year;
They touch the springs of reverie.
They travel homeward quickly, choosing.
They traveled, but a dull hour passed 
They vanish, claimed by the unknown;
They waltz, they bow, they curtsey, flitting
They were unlike as any two men:
They whisper: ^’Dimya, pay attention!”
Thick coffee Orientals prize:
Thinking of Eugene all the while.
Thinks sadly: ''Why am I not ailing.
Thirty -two paces with precision;
This Martin Zadeka, it seems,
This clever jester had to suffer.
This ditty sounds for Tanya’s ring:
This estimable friend embracing.
This ever -rapturous hero, burning
This giddy play in fancy-dress.
This insult was not to be borne.
This is no rhetoric I’m using:
This learned opus one fine day 
This pool we bathe in, friends, this muck 
This strange and sorry character,
This subject filled his conversations.
This too was the old master’s nook;
This way is of all fates the worst.
Thither she came to sport and sing
Those fleshy anchorites alive 
Those gentle hands were stained with gore
Those lovely lips; is it not true?
Thou epic Muse! Upon my way
Though Eugene lent a willing ear.
Though I was worthy your belief,
Though great, the poet’s not conceited.
Though he pursued, the chase was palling; 
Though he was brave, though he was gifted,
Though innocent, are quite absurd.
Though it is true your recollection 
Though it suggests a peasant’s hovel,
Though now a light of no repute.
Though on occasion hke a duffer
Though once they praised my magic pen:
Though there are people, most malicious,
Thought sermons fashioned to annoy;
Thoughts of the future made him whistle;
Three ladies mention a soiree.
Three pairs of truly pretty feet.
Three-fifty was the price bespoken,
Through empty day and idle night:
Through lofty tree-tops everywhere;
Through silent woods, and she discovers 
Through spectacles, with failing eyes,
Through the dim room where I am sitting.
Thus Eugene thought with melancholy.
Thus Lensky his good Mend defended.
Thus a gray hare will quake with fright 
Thus a poor moth imprisoned seeks
Thus autumn gusts deal death and treason.
Thus brilliantly begins the ball.
Thus darkly drives the storm that shrouds 
Thus far away her thoughts are flying;
Thus grows a seed the earth has hidden 
Thus he grew restless and decided
Thus once again he manifested
Thus people, frankly I confess,
Thus sunk in reveries, he nearly
Thus to rush forth, then lapse in quiet
Thus you, Yazykov, when affection
Thus, for an evening game of whist,
Till Lensky, too absorbed to look,
Till from his dressing-room he’d pass.
Till somehow the long evening’s ended,
Till travel, as you’ll have inferred,
Time was when all the world was vying
Time was when she would be composing
To -write in French . , . What’s to be done? 
To 0 . . . our neighbor. Oh, but he
To Eugene, who at once goes dancing 
To Lensky’s wrath: he would not see
To Moscow: it’s the brides’ bazaar;
To Olga’s voice: away she went,
To Olga. First they spin about.
To Olga: "I am happy— no?”
To Tanya of the days that were;
To a new pose will he be goaded,
To a toilette you must admire,
To an ambitious author’s whims:
To answer when the lady speaks.
To ask Anisya for the key.
To be his relative’s sole heir.
To be united to his own,
To brush the shy lips of a maiden 
To call it dirty is no lie.
To call that friend of freedom wrong.
To cast forced shade upon the street.
To choose such moral tales as might 
To classicism doffed my hat:
To come today, and without fail.
To crowding slaves on every side?
To darkness’ kind abode repairing,
To decent folk, and with a smile.
To disavow- it now-. I read
To do full justice to the table,
To drink a toast to his fair neighbor,
To drown the jealous whispering.
To dwell on sorry things so long.
To earn a luncheon from the two,
To earn a smile, a dream, a tear.
To face our foes as all men must,
To find a Moscow magazine
To flowery field and village sport,
To flute and viol’s merry sound.
To follow you with deep devotion;
To fondle either parent never
To free its wings, and frantic, pushes
To friend and child and faithful wife;
To gather tribute from the dell.
To get it, friends, do you recall?
To give me over to despair.
To go: he had no wish to stay.
To gossip to about the city
To gossip; but her heart would fill 
To grasp things . . . But you’re growing pale;
To hang upon the young bloods’ tales.
To hapless Tanya . . . Well, and so 
To have our roads completely mended, 
To have two friends at daggers drawn 
To have your humble servant tell
To hear a people’s hymn of praise.
To hear a voice cry: ^'Well? He’s killed.” 
To hear the vulgar chatter there.
To her a tiresome thing she dreamed. 
To her dear hero she addresses.
To her to whom his heart belongs,
To her vain passion day by day;
To him of whom indeed I sing . . •
To him; and thereby sadly daunted, 
To his Tatyana makes his way.
To his dear charmer his own verses?
To his estate about this time 
To his sharp judgments, sullen wit.
To hold the pistol straight and steady;
To holding poets’ sweet inventions.
To horse’s stamp and human speech!
To hurry them: he cannot wait.
To join the hateful worldly flurry.
To keep his hopeless ledgers clear.
To kiss the breast with languor laden;
To know Onegin really well.
To know you: spirit tuned to spirit;
To learn my Eugene’s air of scorn.
To leave . . . Our Eugene could not stir.
To leave such quiet haunts as these 
To leave, is gone; they let time slip 
To let the tender habit seize me;
To let the worldlings take the measure
To liken do-re-mi to wine.
To listen to you, late and soon;
To long to clasp your knees, and, throbbing
To love all ages owe submission;
To love and idleness devoted.
To make a guest exclaim at it.
To make a man feel like an ass,
To make his noble coflSn ready:
To make the soul of man rejoice 
To masquerade in male attire.
To me all this is naught. This minute
To me alone he dedicated! . . .’?
To meet his fathers speedily;
To merchants; we have but one fear:
To method, he would not allow 
To mist her wide and tender eyes.
To mourn his absence, and in vain.
To move you even while you slept;
To my old nurse, my childhood’s friend;
To no one, friends, you must believe me:
To note how little she is stirred;
To one who is but half-alive:
To one whose soul has perished, and 
To overhear what they may say.
To play a game of cards with me,
To play with tender reveries.
To plunge their tinkling pitchers there,
To poetry’s exalted flame;
To praise his mind if not his heart,
To praise the dancer now the rage,
To praises imaccustomed grown.
To prink and preen he’d ask no urging,
To promenade, as all do daily.
To reading, where a finger-nail 
To rest from loads I used to bear.
To rest the nags: the halts were boring. 
To roam the forests, green and deep.
To save his honor stood quite ready 
To say, with sorrow in her eyes:
To scan the flags and see what sails 
To scratch her neck, and stubbornly
To see a pedant in a bonnet!
To sit beside an invalid!
To sketch a woman’s legs or head.
To sleep upon the stove.
To soil the sheets with flying quill;
To stand, dear vision, by my bed?
To stormy gaiety a traitor,
To suffer prison, and would fly 
To sunny gardens’ fragrant toil;
To tag each other, or to roam 
To take aim also — ^but just then 
To take the awful cargo home.
To take the letter up and seal it 
To talk and sigh, to jest or grieve
To tempt the sporting man of fashion.
To tempt with tender word and sigh
To tender him the Kremlin keys.
To the inviting sea would fly.
To the kind invalid, and yet 
To the low grave, to sit and weep.
To the low roof to fetch her measure 
To the young ladies what was fated.
To these long letters and these tears.
To think the girl that he adored
To this half-Russian, German-bred.
To this were fribbling hours devoted,
To travel, you must be desiring 
To use her own, and hence they had 
To utter, yet she’d not a trace.
To wander by the lake at leisure,
To wash his face with careful paw,
To watch the swans in some dim valley 
To which we vowed our walks apart,
To which, God help me, I belong.
To whom these faces all appear
To whom your pensive verse belong?”
To win her — showed her such attention! 
To youthful hearts its tempests bring
Today it is my turn to speak.
Together in the forest gloaming;
Together nudge Tatyana and
Together we have traveled far.
Took punishment once in a way.
Took wilful passion for my guide;
Torment the rhymesters a la mode.
Touched by the careless twittering,
Toward the moon her languid gaze,
Towers above the craggy hills,
Town that’s delivered to the flood,
Transparent veil the sky is muffled.
Travels how different a road —
Triquet turns, with his sheet, to her,
Triquet; next follow two adepts:
Truly, a beatific land.
Tufted with snow; the stars are shining 
Tug at the leather rein, and turning
Tumansky in sonorous stanzas
Turn pale or blush, as one distressed . . .
Tutored by her own wit — she duly 
Two Petriads, and a collection
Two days he found it quite diverting:
Two fluffy furrows as it races;
Two girls would come, and sadly twining 
Two hearts, a torch, and flowers, be sure, 
Two hearts, one may perhaps believe.
Two merchants have already met.
Two minutes passed with neither speaking,
Two slender boughs are flung across
Two-legged millions are our tools;
U pon your honor I depend.
Unbidden guests; the scene abashes 
Undressed at last and went to bed.
Unheeded in her great dark eyes.
Unhesitatingly she ran.
Unknown to butterfly and bee.
Unless indeed we send a card
Unspoiled by the vain show and fleeting
Until Breguet’s unsleeping chime
Until a great discovery
Until the flames blazed up anew
Until, near dawn, his head was dropping 
Unutterably dear and fair.
Up through the flue the pipe -smoke passes; 
Up to its roof was past all praise. 
Up to the steps, in coach and shay, 
Upon ''ideal” — modish word —
Upon Zarema? To the same 
Upon a fair Venetian face,
Upon a succulent fat pie
Upon a trailing branch suspended
Upon each other’s necks they fall.
Upon her balcony alone
Upon her heart, as though a rumbling 
Upon her shamed and flaming cheeks;
Upon her tray a steaming cup:
Upon her wrath her lips are sealed.
Upon his brow the mark of death,
Upon his sledge tries out the road;
Upon its staples, not on gold —
Upon my dreaming soul intrude.
Upon the azure, pale and tender.
Upon the bachelor’s sad existence;
Upon the boards still flutter free,
Upon the chapters in your hand, 
Upon the couch, a riding-crop.
Upon the dam leaned Lensky, waiting.
Upon the death of his dear father
Upon the distant hills lay light.
Upon the dull mind’s slumbers break.
Upon the finished product then;
Upon the floor Triquet we view 
Upon the good old-fashioned ways 
Upon the granite parapet.
Upon the magic of that stream —
Upon the nameless river’s shore
Upon the oak her tufts are hung;
Upon the pages everywhere 
Upon the parlor sofa lies
Upon the patriarchal dust,
Upon the sharp -clawed paw he offers,
Upon the stove the cat elected
Upon the streets the snow is lying,
Upon the table gleam the glasses,
Upon the table, piping hot;
Upon the third of January,
Upon the threshold of his grave.
Upon the urn, and think: Til -fated!
Upon those lines of bis commending 
Upon those very boards thereafter.
Upon voluptuous rugs instead.
Upon whose brows methought was hell’s 
Us all, and where I now am told 
V Desert at last the restless city
V He hit an ace, there’s no denying,
V Hence oft he had his stallion saddled
V Is like the poet’s maid, Svetlana,
V She knew what dreams and cards portended,
V To sad Moldavia she wandered.
V With us, to miss a reputation
VI And into golden fragments shivered.
VI And jealous fears my heart are stinging
VI And one and all of them exerted
VI Of Juvenal he could make mention.
VI On secret or on open chaffing.
VI Through meadowland and linden alley.
VI Was also picked to pieces duly,
VVll Alas, in dreams, asleep or waking,
Vague threats, predictions, and suspicions,
Vast wastes, and billows diamond-crested.
Verse full of amatory foUy,
Viewed by the archive youths w^ho cluster
Vladimir Lensky, handsome, youthful,
Vladimir made a dry response 
Vladimir shuts the book, and then
Vladimir too had odes to write,
Vladimir was completely captured
Vli Trochaic from iambic measure,
Vll A wreath, that by the breeze befriended
Vll And later privately defame them
Vll And the assorted ranks and ages,
Vll Since nature, fond of contradiction,
Vll With equal warmth a comrade’s greeting
Vlll A shape wherein imagination
Vlll Admired his judgment, always steady.
Vlll Alas! a young and lively maiden
Vlll And I am not exaggerating
Vlll And as of yore play the odd fellow?
Vlll And day by day in pensive yearning
Volume the third of Marmontel,
W hen he comes, ah, when he comes.
W hy did you come to visit us?
W'^e ... we don'll shine in any way.
W'hose raptures are forever stilled.
WHERE WILL YOU FIND A BETTER PLACE, GOOD SIR? 
Wades through the streets, if he but can;
Walked to the stream below the hill; 
Wants one thing further, more’s the pity;
Was all the art of love required.
Was bold enough to challenge you —
Was bored again beyond all measure; 
Was bored with everything he tried,
Was but a boy, if truth were told.
Was ever harder task invented?
Was he the carefree soul he seemed?
Was it not thus I long since spent
Was it not you who gently gave me
Was jesting subtly and displaying 
Was love: he sang it late and soon,
Was one that I found exquisite.
Was our morose Tatyana’s way.
Was pleasure happiness in sooth
Was quite the rustic engineer.
Was reverie; she wreathed with dream 
Was sleeping, heedless of the clock;
Was the interpreter of dreams.
Was the sad singer shocked to learn 
Was to a single occupation;
Was to be readily forgot.
Was with Tatyana — ^not, forsooth,
Was wooed by passionate young devils*
Was yet a thorough Russian; hence
Watched fondly, in seclusion growing,
We’ll go together , . . Oh, my chest! . . .
We’ll listen to the forest voices.
We’ll split apart the mountain ridges,
We’re all Napoleons, we’re certain —
We’re put to sleep by moral tales;
We both had played with passion, early
We both had wearied of the game;
We buy with timber and with tallow:
We call it — if no trace I find 
We can’t please the fastidious.
We careless fellows leave the fretting
We have so many neighbors, I
We loved them, though, when we were young
We met by chance; /, though^ perceiving
We need the wit that nature gave us 
We scared patrols with blatant noise;
We shall have arched, cast-iron bridges
We show at aU times due respect,
We sing about a lucky maid.
We think good wishes are the thing.
We were in reverie transported.
We win the game that w^e are playing.
We won good old Derzhavin’s blessing
We yet attend upon the word
We yielded to delicious dreaming.
Wearied by what he had desired.
Wearing a look of self-possession,
Well I remember waves in riot
Well, must you go now? Not so fast!
Well, take it, since you are so sly!).
Went forth, in dress — a London dandy.
Went off and talked in solemn wise;
Went raving mad or worse: became 
Wept o’er her daughter as they parted,
Were all of them, as well you know.
Were all unconsciously revealing:
Were banished by her animation,
Were bliss; and death? I should not fear it!
Were greeted, with almost dismaying
Were in no instance trained upon her,
Were it not better, if before
Were ladies of a certain age,
Were proper people to engage;
Were set upon those casks of wine.
Were signs and warnings to confound her — 
Werther, to be a martyr fated,
What’s said beside the fading fire.
What London haberdashers hallow
What anguished longing held me fast!
What are her reveries unspoken?
What biting words the rogue would utter
What came of it: Always prepared.”
What dazzling hopes awhile are yours.
What difference does that make to me?
What does my future hold in store?”
What hidden meaning in it lies.
What is he? A mere imitation,
What is it? Water! And this lack 
What languor fills her lovely breast!
What languor in her magic glances!
What more is asked? The world is warm
What more, my friends, do you demand? 
What of it? Though his eyes were busy,
What of the tryst, then, so iU-fated?
What passage, what remark delighted
What petty thought? What trivial feeling? 
What pride, what grief, what thoughts of her!
What shipments are in quarantine?
What sight thus fills him with dismay?
What such a nightmare signifieso 
What talk of famine, plague, or war?
What tears I shed you do not know.
What the word relatives embraces.
What time it is with no Breguet 
What verse, what talk, how fair a dream!
What, in the country, when it’s dreary.
Whate’er was to befall Vladimir,
Whatever in these careless stanzas
When Eugene reached the restless season
When I am gone, and cannot know it.
When I knew ardor and elation.
When I was but a tiny boy!
When I was gone three years, and wandered 
When I was young — a mere suggestion ...”
When Tanya’s tender message came;
When a fine lady seeks to win me 
When all went out to say farewell,
When at my mistress’ feet I lay
When at my tasks of charity.
When dawn’s fiirst ray had barely shown;
When destiny brought us together?
When evening comes he will repair.
When every walk fresh wonders yields;
When guests are there, she says a word
When guests arrive she pays no heed.
When he had come, and if, of late.
When he lies deaf to your appeal?
When he was calling on an aunt 
When his hot fingers touch her hand.
When his poor head began to ache;
When in the banquet-hall he beamed 
When in the springtime I would dally
When into the hushed study came 
When mutely on your brink I pondered
When on the grass in Spring it’s pressed,
When on the ground you see him, stricken. 
When once again, inspired, ecstatic,
When once the breath of spring assails me, 
When passion’s fires no longer smolder,
When scarce a lad, his heart was captured —
When shall I meet the girl at last
When she can only throw cold water 
When springtime’s sun shines warm above: 
When suddenly they’re visited
When sweetly through the doors and surely 
When the cool messenger of morning.
When the deep shades of night are thinning:
When there’s no duty on the wine?
When they discussed some weighty matter,
When they employed the mother-tongue;
When two feet tripped toward their lover! 
When we see him nearing us.
When we were young, we did not tarry.’ ”
When will you lose remembrance of them?
When with diaphanous pale light
When writing his extravaganzas
When writing that intelligent,
When, a Lyceum lad, I flourished.
When, wrapped in storm, shall I be battling
Where’er it goes, I am its lover:
Where’s youth (the rhyme comes glibly) banished? 
Where I can . . .” "Ah, another pretty
Where I would loll, without a goal, 
Where Tanya’s met with ”oh-s” and ”ah-s,” 
Where Tanya met him face to face.
Where Thalia as she’s gently napping 
Where all is silent, dark and drear.
Where are the storms of love and longing.
Where did her sister take her grief?
Where did she learn this wild excess?
Where entertainment was but scant;
Where go, you madman, to forget?
Where guests disperse, or at a ball!
Where he had met her ravished gaze.
Where is compassion, where confusion?
Where is he? Y'es, I know the one.”
Where is the burning agitation.
Where is the noble aspiration.
Where is the saturnine betrayer,
Where is your Mend?” the hostess said;
Where lindens hide the lovers well;
Where long my buried heart has lain.
Where love burned like a living coal.
Where moonlight silvered shrub and stone, 
Where old Neva’s gray waters flow,
Where she, with God knows who for neighbors.
Where should I seek a dearer treasure?
Where spelling has been sadly spited,
Where still the bloody ghost pursued.
Where the maids sang to keep from cheating
Where the quick sunbeams on it play,
Where to, God knows; she never said.
Where will my naughty lad repair?
Where winds and tempests were forbidden,
Where winter-long you were so gay;
Where you were born, or, as a beau.
Where, in the shadow of the wings.
Where, on a rustic bench at last
Where, set in alphabetic order.
Whereby the mind or heart is shaken.
Wherein agreeable vice prevails.
Wherever there is Russian ground.
Which he declaims with ecstasy
Which nowadays seems somewhat queer.
Which ripens fairly, but to drop;
Which told him that his uncle lay 
While Cicero could scarcely please;
While I lie lapped in rural peace!
While doctors hemmed and women cried.
While in due time Monsieur replaced her,
While in the doorway took his station —
While in the garden’s lavish shade 
While into town the milkmaid presses, 
While our sad rhymesters earn a kick?"
While round the tents that nomads raise
While the dull husband, fully knowing 
While we, with married life not smitten. 
While wildly aU the fiddles sing
While winter’s carpet, softly shining.
While with his clumsy Russian hammer
While, on the other hand, his wife
Whispers an outworn compliment,
White hand he swiftly smoothed his hair, 
Whither Onegin in a flurry
Who’s had three thousand years of praise.
Who best knows how to separate.
Who by the high gods’ will is fated
Who called him everything that’s vicious 
Who cannot feel: he is too clever.
Who does not drain the brimming cup,
Who early found both death and glory.
Who fathered the vast universe.
Who hear November at the gate.
Who is inspired in his distress:
Who likes a bribe as much as meat.
Who loves you more may write yet more.”
Who neither crack nor are a joke!
Who never longed and never hated.
Who sees the dark on every hand?
Who taught her how to be so lavish
Who thought our Eugene was a gull;
Who tmto every fascinator
Who was the fair young poet’s slayer?”
Who will assent to all we say?
Who will not seek our faults to flout us?
Who will not spread vile lies about us? 
Who will not weary us, with speed?
Who will recall my poor creations.
Who will supply our every need?
Who would not tire of threats and rages,
Who would not weary of evasion.
Who, in this cool majestic woman.
Who, lulling reason, comes to rest
Who, yawning, with his friends and wife.
Whoever you may be, my reader,
Whole families of neighbors driving
Whom silence was about to throttle,
Whom you have found so interesting?
Whom, at the start of our romance,
Whose days are living poetry —
Whose heart belonged to other days.
Whose heart experience has chilled,
Whose hearts the years at length anneal; 
Whose peasants live in beggary;
Whose posture was of one defeated.
Whose satisfactions were, through life, 
Whose secret solace on the heart
Whose shade across the mill-pond lies 
Whose soul was shaped in Gottingen, 
Why do you pay me these attentions? 
Why don’t I travel with a crutch.
Why is Tatyana an offender?
Why is he here? Who is he? Task him!
Why not, like that poor Tula man.
Why not? You can have no objection.
Why set two ages thus at odds?
Why should you have such veneration
Why thus dispense with lawful labor?
Wili cure the lad, for good or ill.
Will be the subject of my story.
Will bravely face the stake, nor wax 
Will feel her heart with pity burning.
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Will it no more return to me?
Will look with scorn on my distress!
Will love again. But self-control,
Will not debate and ponder it
Will not your soul be filled with rue
Will square accounts, whoever falls.
Will tell the story of your fate.
Will you not come to shed a tear
Wilno. His brother went to Constantinople and after- 
Wind-tossed, and all too soon decay.
Wine of the Don, to drink a toast.
Winter, the sorceress, ’tis she!
With Eugene, and with him alone.
With French it’s spotted like a leopard —
With Lensky’s fate is occupied;
With Ozerov’s grave lines and tragic. 
With a French volume in her hand.
With a feigned chill in look and voice. 
With a fine mind and handsome face;
With a gay jest and words untrue.
With a too wanton kind of fun.
With all a dandy’s mind can limn.
With anguish, pour out at your feet 
With ardent words, and how to ravish 
With blotted rhyme and criss-cross kiss — 
With caution through the key -hole spying
With chairs and chests and casseroles,
With chalk. No knock can ever waken 
With cocks in cages (these one slaughters
With dancing blood, with living heat.
With dignity brings forth his lay.
With drooping head and languid bearing
With easy grace of this and that.
With ecstasy, but with regret.
With every church in bright attire.
With every jealous word he reckoned,
With fiery imagination.
With flame that fails as it appears;
With flashing eyes Onegin rises
With flattering pen and heart aglow.
With foreign words; their frequency 
With frowning brow he would be sitting 
With her Onegin at her side —
With her neat monogram in wax.
With him the humble road of life.
With his last victory, awaited 
With his own pawn takes his own rook.
With his own self dissatisfied.
With his red belt and sheepskin coat.
With his sardonic comedies;
With hope, then prove it an illusion,
With its unseasonable strife 
With jams and featherbeds and bowls.
With jealousy revive it next.
With joy the contemplative soul!
With kindly hand the old man’s bays.
With lampions bright on sills and ledges
With laughter and with noisy sport.
With lowered horns, a lonely deer;
With most folk, custom’s rule prevails.
With most polite and cool address,
With motley figures: people dart
With noisy haste the throng decamps;
With none to understand or cherish
With olden days and doddering nurses:
With other children scarcely ever.
With other days come other dreams,
With perfect fireedom she receives him;
With pipe alight you’d find me sipping
With proud perukes and red-heeled shoes.
With pure devotion, knew no bliss 
With rebel will and lively mind.
With roaming flocks was lightly spotted;
With rosy light the eastern skies,
With sails and rich thick traflic crowded,
With scorn; yet smiles upon the lips 
With shouts and plaudits. Tanya now 
With sighs I think, bemused adorer,
With silver hoar, the meadows lie . . • 
With skill and passion, touch and smile.
With solemn gait and sparkling eye.
With sorrow, but her tears were brief.
With splendor unaccustomed eyes.
With stormy passion’s heat she blazes;
With studied ways amused the crowd
With sudden passion, sudden pain . . .
With tea and jam, and endless tattle
With the avow'als of a boy.
With the coarse salt of malice, while 
With the ninth wave the ship’s arriving
With them, a red-wigged man in glasses:
With those Chateaubriand could write;
With two or three bright -backed imported 
With us, but grows apace; indeed, 
With utmost speed Onegin dresses,
With whirling thoughts his soul grew dizzy,
With you, nor yet with you who spin 
Within me — they have found surcease:
Within my garden, unexpected;
Within the gondola’s embrace
Within the hill -encircled valley
Within, a noisy clatter swells;
Within, you hear the feet still pounding.
Without a tavern of its own.
Without affairs, or rank, or wife,
Without them, there’s no paradise.
Worthy of him I am addressing,
Would always give three balls a year;
Would be dismayed to see him there;
Would be in every way far better 
Would chide him, would forgive him soon.
Would cite a verse he had by heart,
Would dare to seek that gentle girl?
Would dream of walking, bride and wife.
Would drop so tenderly at even . . .
Would fail to show Diana gleaming,
Would fly the place: she cannot stir;
Would gallop side by side with me!
Would grow more ardent very often,
Would he be Melmoth or Childe Harold,
Would make the den her library.
Would ravish one who prized the treasure
Would scarcely call intelligent.
Would show him every friendliness; 
Would start a quarrel quite as shrewdly, 
Would turn quite taciturn with languor, 
Would, in a body, call at eve.
Would, tete-a-tete, where no one heard.

Yes, jealousy’s attacks can seize us
Yes, now the door is opened for them,
Yet all is well — each has its due:
Yet bidding the poor girl adieu,
Yet grieve for him . . . But wherefore grieve?
Yet in vain boredom I am wasting
Yet soon they let down their defences.
Yet, as a rule, despised mankind;
You’d find the way of vice was hard,
You’d give him Adam Smith to read.
You’ll bid us free, to speed our task,
You’ll grant it’s time to part, my dears.
You’re bored.” ”As ever. But I mark
You also, youthful belles, belated
You are an early bird! Last night
You are the helpmeet I’d be choosing:
You are to come, and named the day.”
You came and lectured me so coldly —
You came in dreams: I feared to waken,
You care to? Check accounts, or drink,
You dwell in dreams, and you persist 
You handsome albums decorated
You haunts where I might stay in hiding. 
You have a Russian family setting,
You have a fever . . .” "Fever, no:
You hear amid the gay street’s fluster
You in my fond imagination . . .
You knew Ruslan and fair Ludmila;
You knew the answer — as you say: 
You know the truth? What is the use 
You know; besides, all lots were equal 
You lectured me, I listened, meek;
You looked in at the house just twice
You made me drunk in other days.
You may dismiss them as unfit
You may expect no less firom me;
You may rely upon the fair,
You men who lived in wedded bliss
You might be pleased — if so, advise me —
You mothers, as your own once did.
You prove you know, beyond a doubt,
You rustic Priams, and you gentle
You scarce can get a dish of pottage:
You seek: be it extravaganzas 
You shone as with a nuptial splendor:
You should perceive udth eye severe 
You sigh, and think with farrowed brow —
You smooth his pillow and contrive
You spend your time, I’d like to know?”
You spoke, my very soul was shaken.
You still retain the memory 
You too, farewell, my curious neighbor.
You venerator of the Muse
You who will smooth in after days
You witness of that fallen glory.
You woodlands where I used to roam,
You, dreams of sacred poesy?
You, figments of sweet reverie.
You, readers, with another tale:
You, you alone would be my wife.
Young Olga coming to make tea,
Young Olga was the first to stir;
Young Tanya, whom I still hold dear.
Young girls, in passing, hushed their chatter;
Young love, because it is so blind,
Young timid love, and that was shocking. 
Your Grandison?” "I can’t remember —
Your Madam Larina’s, I find,
Your Olga’s face, so round and blooming.
Your Olga? And Tatyana too?”
Your Phyllis, whom you idolize.
Your candor filled me with confusion;
Your charm? My verses sang your praise; 
Your dreams, your high simplicity.
Your frank avow-al touched me nearly.
Your friendship.” At this invitation 
Your grief wall bring me to remorse?
Your heart responded how? Pray, tell!
Your honor’s most astute defender —
Your look that made my spirit sink!
Your magic music and your skill:
Your marked seducer you discern.
Your own young days. Were you in love?”
Your pleasures with a taste more keen,
Your scorn. You did not find surprising 
Your spouse awaits; come to me, come! . . .”
Your version of Tatyana’s letter
Your way in soulful flight and free.

Your winter is cut out for you.

Her sister tempts the Muse, not she.

Of Moscow beaus and Moscow Circes!
The colonel’s sending it. A ball!
Heloise; Clarissa: the heroine of Clarissa Harlotve; 
The city breathes of Europe; hotly.
Of my young friend I sing, and of
No smart conceits does Lensky fashion
Thus Lensky his good Mend defended.

But in parenthesis I mention:
And steps across; her Mood congeals;
Because it’s long since I have sinned.

Sacred to scions of Apollo!
I married. Now, I beg you, go.

XXlll His friend Onegin by recalling
And Lucifer’s hailed by the cock;
The bank; one hears a gentle spring;
The ballroom’s ruler, scarcely human.
And Strasbourg pies, imperishable;
XXlll A glance upon their urgent lovers.
And Lensky — Tanya; Kharlikova,
XXlll The cabinet where fashion’s student
And Tanya found the journey bleak.
And Turkish pipes of amber rare,
And a shy maiden’s pure caress.
XXll While in the lobby sleepy flunkeys
And all distraction finds her jaded,
And all exclaim delightedly
XXlll The pains of love still agitated
The ball-room summons one and all.
And all that Paris in her passion
And all that sparkles, triumphs, sings.
And all their w’ayward stirrings cease, 
And all, our tender dreamer fused 
The ball had pierced clean through the breast.
And always needing some correction,
And an eternal friendship plighted
And an old gentleman espied her,
And answer with the barest greeting.
And I shall speak, if you allow,
And as a child she’d romp and play
And as a rural miss appears
And as he reads, both thought and feeling
And as he says farewell again 
And as it hisses, gently steaming.
And as on these his fancy dwelt,
And as she looked about, dejected, 
And as she reads, the tears will rise
And at the following sweet session
And at the stations lice and roaches
And at the tavern-door the clack
The fathers, indeed all, could see
XXll That there were works he never banished
And been a faithful wife and mother.
And behaved well, you will agree;
And bids his servant, since time presses,
And bids us cast away the wreath 
XXll She was his lyre’s first inspiration,
And blessed the man who rids him of 
And blesses, as he halts his clamor,
And blissful still, since all unknowing,
And boasted, bold beyond all measure. 
And boasts the freedom of the wings,
And both, though young, could but await
And breathe the free air of the stage,
And brooklets murmured pleasantly, 
And brushes, thirty shapes and sizes.
And I have learned how to be meek*
And by this shaking bridge affrighted,
XXli In whom discover no defection?
And can you not forgive, if she
And carried to that region where
And caught that foot in these two hands;
XXXvii Imagination is unreeling
And chats of this and that politely;
XXXlll She used a sing-song voice; and, posing,
XXXlli Alas, these missives fare no better.
And clinch the point with a quotation.
And closed his turbulent career 
The ball’s wild gaiety was wearing.
XXXll Was at that moment busy gloating
XXXll The blood from the fresh wound was steaming;
And credit the world’s fair appearance; 
And crossed the girl, and as she made 
And crosses black with flocks of daws.
And I confess I am perplexed:
XXXVlll Like many others have been fated
The tune, however, threatens her;
And damask of the drawing-room —

XXXVlll And, if a black-eyed girl permitted,
And day will brighten wold and wave,
And did his shade in sorrow yearn?
And does his somber aspect mean 
And does not cease to pine and fret.
And does not pay the least attention.
XXXVll I shall, to pleasure you, detail.
XXXVlii A poet — this were paying dearly
And dream about his native land.
XXXV Eating the pancakes custom hallowed;
And dreams and musings far from gay.
And drink desire’s sweet poisoned potion.
XXXIX Sometimes a kiss as fresh as she,
And I am such. Was it naught better
And drunken stamp of the trepak,
XXXIX But he has not become a poet,
XXXIV One who, by a rash glance offended.
And entered. Here the throng is trooping; 
And enters softly without rapping,
And enters the deserted court.
And epigrams that scored a hit.
And every query, every tale,
The tw"o explore the garden’s charm.
And far too wretched to be meek
XXlll Was gentle Olga — ^in her dimple
And faster, faster throbs her heart.
And fawn and play the hypocrite.
And feelings, long quiescent, stirred;
And feigned the pang of jealousy,
And find, wherever she may sally
And fled afar . . . She followed me.
And fleeing, breaks the lilac-bushes,
XXXI And girlish fits of nerves he hated:
And for the pranks he liked to play
And for the simple churchyard, telling
And forthwith to a ball he flew.
And found a partner in another.
And found his comments sane and smart.
XXX You tomes wherewith resplendent ladies
And found their prudent talk vexation;
And freighted with a youthful gloom 
And friendly husbands’ heavy cheer?
XXX With the emotions that assail her
And fright but bred fidelity;
And from the servants’ anxious eyes.
And gains the brookside, breathing fast.
And gave his neighbor’s ribs a dig.
And girls who kiss with laughs and hugs,
And glance, unwilling, in the glass.
And glances at the door by stealth.
And golden autumn is arriving.
And gorges seven days a week.
XXVll Expenses, and therewith decided
And grief changed to serenity.
And grow, with time, intelligent.
And guard your daughters more severely.
XXVI The learned world would have me mention
XXV Why should one quarrel with good breeding?
The baker’s German and precise.
And had his last farewells to say.
And had no word for him but blame —
xliii How did you take my girUsb letter?
And hand meets hand, and hearts beat high; 
xliii In dashing cabs, you too were fated
And hard and cold, and petrify 
And has she found the word? She lets
And having noted, in a pet.
And having stared through my lorgnette
XXI ^^Oh, golden days, my springtide cherished.
And Grandison, who leaves us sleeping.
And he was not the least elated 
And he will throw you in a trice.
XXI The fearful shadows gather thickly;
And he, reluctant to surrender,
And health and hope and joy are banished:
The autumn seemed so loth to go;
And hear, above the lake, their cries,
XXI Onegin presses; with his vaunted
And her head sinks. The dawn grows bolder, 
And here hussars on leave, resplendent
XXI And firmly count upon preserving
And Fontenelle, acute, eupeptic;
And his cheek pale, she does not see 
And his the charm of simple art.
And holding him in such affection
And hotter yet the blush is glowing
And how it strikes me, never mind).
And hurriedly before it perished
And if her soul was deeply stirred,
At the sad turning of the years,
And if the sudden sight dismayed her.
And in a voice pohte but reedy
And in an attitude confiding,
And in due time the husband passed 
And in exchange he took as well
XXI And came to the abandoned dwelling
The aunts, of one thing only thinking.
And Flyanov, somewhat ill, encumber
XX The gallery claps and stamps, atwitter;
The two Skotinins, gray as sages.
And in the court gay magpies screamed;
And in the crowd that filled the hovel,
XX Quite tete-a-tete he’d lectured duly
And in the mist her little finger
And in the misty moonlight furled.
And in the sleigh most carefully
And integers: ourselves alone.
And into the deep forest plunges;
XXviii And off into the fields she rushes,
And it is %^ery hard to bear
And it is precious, being brief:
XVlll Please follow me,” she said politely.
And its cold white magnificence:
The two friends’ greetings; and the tears 
The album and the corset vanished,
And jealous in a frigid way.
And jealous longing frets the maid —
XVlll Had Tanya known that on the morrow
And know that heart will never quicken?
And lands remote, where on the breast
XVll To come, as from another planet,
And leave the forests gaunt and harsh.
XVll A goose’s snaky neck bestriding —
And let his tears unheeded shower;
And lifts his hand as who defies
And lightly clad, though airs were chill,
And likes the pallid evening light
XVl She drops her eyes, her heart is aching.
And lives like a true sage at last,
And locked him in a corner where
The aged, at the grave’s grim portal.
And Dunya squeaks (would she were dumb!)
XVii They’ve raised a thirst there is no quenching.
XVi Upon Ms beaver collar falling.
And loved the duties well fulfilled.
And many a solemn protestation 
And mists above the meadows brooded;
And modern man’s true soul divulging:
And more play whist, whose fame’s enduring —
And mortgaged all the land he owned.
And most, the linden-shaded ways
And murmur sing-song confidences,
At the gay spectacle turned hollow. 
And my heart whispered: it is he!
And my own man I want to be.
And near a stream, stood calm and proud, 
And neighbor wheezes unto neighbor.
And never after that went near it.
And never loved where it desired,
And never said his passions nay.
XVI She hears wild shouts and glasses clinking
And next the girl’s guitar we see;
And night would find her far from sleep. 
XVI Of foreign history and Russian,
And no calumnious friend so pert
And none can hear his neighbor speak.
And not a single w^ord deleted;
XVI I might just see the house and garden,”
And not long years of separation,
And not without a tell-tale blush.
And notes complexions, with a sneer
And nothing to remark or pardon;
The two old women weep, embrace.
Xli 'When they proclaim you odd or vicious,
And now she leaps and claps her heels.
And now the guests, exchanging glances.
And now they bring out eighteen jades.
An uhlan wooed her, not in vain;
And now, at spring’s bright invitation.
XVI Broods over all he dare not say:
And nowhere is a spot of ink.
And nurses scream and children roar.
And of repeating platitudes,
The Vampire wrecks her sleep at night;
And offer hospitality.
And oh, they are a weary weight!
And old companions, dull and vicious;
And on Caucasian cliffs how often.
XV Your fate is put into the keeping
And on her shoulder leans his head;
And on the last page this reflection:
And on the lovage dropped a tear.
XV Whose spouse has left her, discontented.
Xli There was something intelligible
And one fibne morning finds him flying
XV The dancers from the green were wending.
The unconcerned beloved anew.
And one would find the children roaming
XV So immature and so beguiling.
And out of an old-fashioned notion
Xlll I shall yet cease to be a poet;
The Muse has come, and love departed,
And pity took the place of anger.
XV Men, while they did not dare pursue her.
And pleading first that by-and-by
And pleasant though it is to roam.
XV And, full of grief, the wistful dreamer
And ponder each move’s secret meaning.
And praise Odessa’s gardens greatly.
And presses her soft hand — elation
And pride that ever looks askance.
And prim young misses looking sage;
And promised them each year again
And prompts something satirical;
And purr the while: Tatyana saw
And puts her little hand at length 
And quite as faithless as their feet.
The Muse first shone before my eyes.
XU No helping hand is near to lead her
The Muse — to marriage been converted.
And rash the question that she broaches:
The very boon they would petition,
And resolute, she shipped the peasant
XIV Deeply disturbed as thus she tasked him.
And rightly: for Onegin, sitting
And roam the sea’s expanse, unpent.
And roamed its gardens at my ease,
And rootless dreams that could not last,
And round the loaded carriage crowded,
And sadly, virginally sighing,
And scrapes his chair along the floor;
With a feigned chill in look and voice. 
XIV A lady down the room advances,
And seemed about to faint and fall;
XIV A branch leans down to snare her tresses,
An idle, cheerless recluse, near
The Kalmucks’ flocks, contented, graze. 
An honest fellow, be it noted.”
And served each course to them by rank.
And setting up a new regime;
And shall return to him, I vow,
XIII The base coquette before the duel;
XIII Of her rough lackey is behind her,
And she will learn my knowledge of
XIII (A plaguey wish by which are guided
And show commercial enterprise.
XI The local gentry’s round of pleasure
And shun the heart that would be tender.
And silently recall the past?
And silhouetted by the beams,
XI That he was yet a man of feeling.
And sinks from sight, soon to be crumbling. 
And sleep at last her boon conferred;
And sleighing, and, when light grew dimmer,
And slept beside her every night.
And smoothly glide on polished boards; 
XI That Olga’s love, alas, was mortal.
And so God grant them health and cheer!
XI She walks across a snowy clearing,
And so for days poor Tanya broods.
And so from idle talk she flies.
And so he’ll rifle keener minds;
And so her quick imagination
The Horse Guard’s spurs clank as he dances;
And so of course the girl decided
XI He could pretend despair, to frighten.
And so the guests would say good-bye.
X. is an admirable man.
And so they aged, like all things mortal,
An exquisite both bold and natty.
And so without more words, departed;
X Who ripened, like good port or sherry,
X She is the novelist’s creation:
X Severe, and he was not acquitting
An escort much, puffed out his chest 
The Hindu — diamonds in his coffer;
And soon the east will be alight;
And soon their tongues begin to race.
And sooth, I fled these haughty belles 
X Serene as maidens simple-hearted.
And staring in dismayed surprise,
And started on his aimless cruising.
The English spleen it may resemble,
An eiffort to converse with her.
An ardent faith in liberty.
And stop defenceless in the field.
Glass after glass is drained in drenching
And such a crowd, a perfect rabble . .
And suddenly he’s at the gate.
An ancient, with perfumed gray hair, 
And swift to flee from fun and folly,
And talk that brighten’s friendship’s ways.
And tears of reconciliation
And tedious planned holidays.
And tells her doll with anxious thought
And terror-stricken would await
And that between her teeth, to greet 
And that for many a long day.
And that it cheated us again;
And the cool yawns that come amain. 
And the deep seas His praise rehearse
the last chapter of Eugene Onegin 'eight’ instead of 
And the grave eyes that have undone me
And the improvement will be splendid! 
X Rejoiced the fair one but to grieve her,
X Refused — he soon found consolation;
An alien, roving unrestricted,
And the poor girl is roused betimes
An album verse with tender mien;
And the same pom, and the same spouse, 
And the smooth waters, mirror-bright,
And the two friends for death competing, 
And the word’s new — should not be great.
And the world smiled upon her, pressing
And the young city miss who’s facing
And then appeared a row of glasses.
And then at home all day he stays
X Another captured her attention,
And then sat silent for the nonce.
X And in the bath-house, not the dwelling.
And then, refreshed after a dipping,
And then, with Olga, how he acted!
And there’s a witch with a goatee,
And there a traveler from a distance,
And there beside the rocky shallows
And there he also wrote another
Wrote, on the spot, an elegy.
And there the weary ploughmen dally.
Write prose, and take the humbler way;
Would, tete-a-tete, where no one heard. 
The very hero of our novel!
And think of it! So timid is he,
Would show him every friendliness; 
That youth was given us in vain,
And though he was an ardent rake,
And though the talk of my yotmg friend
And thought he met with no rebuff.
And thought, I do not doubt, of me.
And through the frosty window-pane
Would scarcely call intelligent.
And thunderous, flock eagerly:
Would ravish one who prized the treasure
Would make the den her library.
And to a humble cottage dashes:
And to his stand the cabby goes.
And to my lips the words came thronging;
And to put finis to their chatter;
That you should scorn me, or ignore.
Would grow more ardent very often,
And treading toes, between the chairs 
And trifles of importance to
Would fail to show Diana gleaming,
Would dream of walking, bride and wife.
And tucked away, an almanac
Would cite a verse he had by heart,
And turn the meadow to a marsh 
And turned a joyful face to greet him
Would be in every way far better 
And vainer labor there is none —
And valleys, trees, and hamlets seemed 
And virtue won its due reward.
Amusement while you mix his potion;
Would always give three balls a year;
Without them, there’s no paradise.
And wake the birds in beech and larch.
Without affairs, or rank, or wife,
And was at Olga’s ere he knew it!
And watch her, languidly enchanted!
And watch life’s furrows briefly nourish
And watch the failing of his breath,
And wdth a heart for love designed,
Within, you hear the feet still pounding.
Within the gondola’s embrace
And what the fashions were that fall.
And what the moon might signify.
And what was my amazement, finding
And when a star dropped down the sky
And when consoled by art — and fame,
And when the little girls collected
Within my garden, unexpected;
And when they entered, arm in arm,
And when we find our old devotion 
Among those regions drearily.
Within me — they have found surcease:
And where he left a lasting trace.
And where indeed of her they’re prating.
With utmost speed Onegin dresses,
And where the faithful suitor hovers,
And where the youthful galaxy
With us, but grows apace; indeed, 
And while a husband is respected
And while my wanton muse rejoices
And while the breakfast is preparing
With two or three bright -backed imported 
And while they all are in high feather,
With them, a red-wigged man in glasses:
And whom shall we confide in, pray?
And whom we kiss as they expect,
And why? What am I striving for?
And will accustom us to grammar;
And window -sashes rattled loudly.
With the avow'als of a boy.
With stormy passion’s heat she blazes;
With splendor unaccustomed eyes.
And with good cheer and merry sally
And with love’s sw^eet confusion dizzy,
With sorrow, but her tears were brief.
And with strange languor fill my blood!
And with the malice time imposes.
And with the spark of a bon mot
And without foolish affectation.
With solemn gait and sparkling eye.
Among the tents of nomads moving.
With sighs I think, bemused adorer,
With shouts and plaudits. Tanya now 
And yet her face was pale and clouded
And yet her trust he’d not belie,
And yet more pleasant, on the sly
And yet she found it no affliction —
And yet the auguries perplex her.
And yet win luster from my writing;
With sails and rich thick traflic crowded,
And you shall judge me as you may.
And you, bright phantoms round him thronging,
And you, can you remain the same?
And you, my dear, are doomed to perish;
With rosy light the eastern skies,
With roaming flocks was lightly spotted;
And you, oh, youthful inspiration,
With pure devotion, knew no bliss 
And young in youth; blessed is he 
And your remarkable collection
And, careless of the cold, is training
With proud perukes and red-heeled shoes.
And, fortune’s darling, in his rhyming
And, if my novel is to thrive.
And, seated, eagerly is eyeing

And, with no aim on which to fix,
With pipe alight you’d find me sipping

That year was extraordinary.

With other days come other dreams,
Another’s amorous invention
That will not be ten times repeated
With other children scarcely ever.
Another’s, and his memory 
With olden days and doddering nurses:
Another day without an aim;
With none to understand or cherish
Among the crush of people passes,
With noisy haste the throng decamps;
With motley figures: people dart
Another set of lines transpired 
Another, at a god’s dictation.
Anticipating this distraction.
Apart, Tatyana can but linger
Aplomb, he lifts his eye-glass, stares
Appeal, complaint, confession, sobbing 
Appears, his broom in hand, still blinking;
Approach!” How calm and cold their faces.
With most polite and cool address,
Among sad chffs he moves. I’m fated
With lowered horns, a lonely deer;
With lampions bright on sills and ledges

Are dazzling, and rejoice our hearts.
With jams and featherbeds and bowls.

With its unseasonable strife

Are here cast off, or so the flighty 
Are here, with scissors straight and curved.

Are turned by one cool glance to ice,
Are waltzing round the dancing-floor.
With his red belt and sheepskin coat.
Among her groves and meadows ranging.
Aroused your pity then . . . You’re kneeling 
As Eugene stares his heart is chilled
As Eugene, by regrets distracted.
With his own self dissatisfied.
As I fared onward gloomily,
As I her rustic charms survey.
As Lensky’s life that knew no guile,
As a fit sequel to the roast:
As a good comrade, one who shares 
As at a mighty funeral feast;
With his last victory, awaited 
As did the bard — yet not aquiver
As did this author: chief of all 
As do the sins of years long fled 
As does proud Moscow, in its rights.
As erstwhile comes, to hum an air
Amid the snowdrifts, seething, roaring,
As fancy in the lot would trace 
As fields are blest by storms of spring:
With him the humble road of life.
With her neat monogram in wax.
As he depicted their delights;
As he was followed by the blues.
As her good nurse w^ould have her do:
As hermits live who hope for heaven
As his repellent aid he proffers;
As in a nightmare each one aims
As infant slumbers, as the moon
Always the same and always novel.
As men need air, they found kvass needful,
With her Onegin at her side —
As on a shaky bench he lays her.
Alw"ays together, now they’re sitting
As one who fought forgotten wars
As one who through a fog is peering,
As only passion can have wrought.
As perfect as an illustration —
As rock and wave, or ice and flame.
With foreign words; their frequency 
Although the house was empty, she 
As some time later to assert
That we are driving in the dark.
With flattering pen and heart aglow.
As the dark coverts were denuded;
As the two foes, with even tread.
As though a chiQy hand were laid
As though he’s surely done with books.
With flame that fails as it appears;
As though there were a tacit ban
As through the dust his horses fare.
As upon any other day.
As well as write; and how he bowed!
As wild as they: forsook her songs 
As years went by, and readily
As you discover life’s allures,
That waters well the nearby valley.
As, sped like arrows from the bow.
The view into the moonlit night.
Ashore at last, and our endeavor 
With fiery imagination.
Askance at fair, unwonted faces,
Asked what Onegin’s visit meant,
With every jealous word he reckoned,
Xvii ”What ails you, Tanya?” ^^Oh, it’s trifling,
Although its touch be soft as fleece.
Although indeed I paid attention.
At Europe’s dainty handicraft,
At Whitsun, when the populace
With ecstasy, but with regret.
Although her book has no pretensions
With easy grace of this and that.
At cards with his inheritance!
With drooping head and languid bearing
Although he grew more melancholy,
published under the imprint of Martin Zadeka, a 
The truth, and, God be praised, can see 
At either end the two friends stand.
That time and change may not erase.
With dignity brings forth his lay.
Xxi By little Olga, and, enraptured.
At first Madame controlled the child;
At first but wept and tore her hair.
At first disturbed me, in the end 
With dancing blood, with living heat.
At heart, giving a single jot.
At him . . . And if she was amazed,
At home his pistols claimed attention;
With cocks in cages (these one slaughters
With chalk. No knock can ever waken 
At last she rose, and gently sighing
With chairs and chests and casseroles,
With ardent words, and how to ravish 
With anguish, pour out at your feet 
At length our hollow-hearted hero
That thrilled him in the days gone by,
At noisy gatherings and after.
Ladies he left he never missed.
At once that guests might be expected.
At once the slanderer to defy.
At once, and bear the weapon -case.
At peace, it is my artless pleasure
That the first strophes should be read 
At table, ’neath the damask cover.
With a fine mind and handsome face;
That teeth and nails may both be served.
At the back porch in readiness,
And search my nonsense for some wit.
XXxix God, what can he think of me?”
And if that’s not enough to do,
Along the forest path he crashes.
At dusk the samovar is gleaming
Along dark streets wrapped deep in slumber
That silly moon you see there looming.”
At times she pays him no attention;
At twenty to the fashion bred,
At whiles, upon their elbow's leaning,
With Ozerov’s grave lines and tragic. 
Ausonia’s happy sons are trilling 
With Lensky’s fate is occupied;
Away already: without fail.
With Eugene, and with him alone.
Winter, the sorceress, ’tis she!
Wine of the Don, to drink a toast.
Away, the good old sleigh, at last. 
Away, while the old sleigh was mended 
Awhile all conversation ceases;
Alone? What of the eye-glass, eh?
Wind-tossed, and all too soon decay.
Alone, and sunk in calculation,
The bearded old postilion’s mounted —
written by Ozerov, a dramatist who belonged to the 
Alone the shepherd, weak and hoary.
Bare steppe is all you will behold;
Baroness Barbara von Kriidener; St. Preux and Wol- 
Bassoon and flute at once are heard.
Yawned through the long thanksgiving mass,
Be fact, and can my spring be past 
Be patient, then, as with a brother:
Be quick! Drive on!” he bids the peasant;
Be ruled by what is small and mean?
Will you not come to shed a tear
Will tell the story of your fate.
Be sure you have your grandson go.”
Be thou my staffs nor let me stray.
Alone along the sea-shore; then
Will square accounts, whoever falls.
Bears the proud burden of her rank!
Because he could make no bon mot.
Because he hated litigation
Alone a lazy boatman lifted
Because my husband’s decoration,
Because rash ardor and quick wit
Will not debate and ponder it
The village, where Onegin’s leisure
Aloft, the whole of heaven sees;
Because there was not much to pay,
Will bravely face the stake, nor wax 
Because your honor and your pride 
Why thus dispense with lawful labor?
The father’s simple words repeating.
Befits and pleases you and me?”
Why set two ages thus at odds?
Why not? You can have no objection.
Before her door; he waits for her;
Before her now, without a doubt:
Before him, loud with seething trajfl&c,
Before it’s heard, is grave and quiet.
Why not, like that poor Tula man.
Before the threshing-floor, thick willows 
Before they halted at a gateway 
Before whom my bold lyre is muted,
Before, her bow was as serene.
Begged that her husband sniffer her
Begins to raise his pistol coolly.
Why is he here? Who is he? Task him!
Behind a hill the moon is hidden;
Behind a stump among the trees
Behind the curtain’s funeral fold
Behind the mill they went straightway.
Behind the strange bed’s silken curtain
Why is Tatyana an offender?
The heart that thought its fires had dwindled
The vintage of the comet flows.
Allured by neither looks nor station.
Why do you pay me these attentions? 
Belong to youth, with youth are fled.
Beloved ... or such was his conviction,
Below that other’s signature
Allows a zest to oinr alarm.
Below, though it is early yet,
Beneath her pillow, empty playthings;
Beneath her pillow. Darkness keeps 
Beneath his fingers would have hurled 
Whose shade across the mill-pond lies 
Whose secret solace on the heart
Beneath the Finnish sky, alone.
Beneath the light of stars and lamps.
Beneath the prudent flag of peace.
Beneath the shade of his acacias
Whose satisfactions were, through life, 
Whose posture was of one defeated.
Whose peasants live in beggary;
Beside his heavy mate is lying.
Beside his wife, that chubby charmer.
Beside my quiet lake, beset 
Beside that most superb of creatures,
Beside that stream with shadows laced
Beside the fire a table’s set.
Whose hearts the years at length anneal; 
Beside the stanza all unfinished
Whose heart experience has chilled,
Beside the window; on the pane 
Best leeches send him to the spas.
Whose heart belonged to other days.
Betrayed no anger, no surprise 
Betrays my stomach, and although 
Whom, at the start of our romance,
Between her hours of toil and leisure
That she should offer a narration 
Bewildering the wretched man.
Beyond the grave, yes, at the end 
All wonder whether they see rightly;
Beyond, the plain, with hamlets dotted,
Birch, linden, aspen, all are bare;
Whoever you may be, my reader,
The vista of a free romance!
Bleak tete-a-t^te concludes; he cheers 
Who, yawning, with his friends and wife.
Blessed is he who leaves the glory 
Blessed the new master every day.
Bloomed like a flower in the shade;
Bore to the grave to sleep forever 
Born of a liar in an attic.
Both carriages and people flounder.
Both friends and foes (they’re ail the same).
Both love and malice scarce recalling, 
Both tongue and seal are pink, are dry.
Who, lulling reason, comes to rest
Who, in this cool majestic woman.
Breathes through the words she is inditing.
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Briefly surveying every tier.
Who would not weary of evasion.
Built by the fishermen was flaring.
Bumps down Tverskaya Street already.
But Eugene’s sole preoccupation
But Eugene, now his friend was gone, 
But I’m a dunce! They bade me say
Ye vanished tumults, rest in peace!
But I foresee a fresh objection.
But I grow old, and memory fails;
Who would not tire of threats and rages,
But I, my friend, am not contending
But Tanya’s mother, not ignoring
That scarce had heard of his existence, 
But Tanya had no tears at all;
But Tanya, dreaming, hardly hears,
But Tasso’s murmured octaves are,
But all too soon the summer ends.
But are those stirrups he is hearing?
But as for me . . . my loving praise
But as the rural dusk advances
Who will supply our every need?
But at her window, fain to weep.
But at the late and sterile season,
But bears refreshment and renewal —
But brings to mind our fading years 
But business holds the greater part.
Who will not weary us, with speed?
But by some influence despotic.
Who will assent to all we say?
But by your will; my fate* s decided;
But curious, as maidens are,
But dinner’s served, and arm in arm
But drops it without more ado.
That riots through the mountain passes;
That poor Tatyana was upset.
But ever sadder, ever fonder.
But fast or slow, leave town behind!
But fiery youth cannot dissemble
Who tmto every fascinator
All thoughts, but those of you, rejected.
But first, what dark delight you cherish, 
Who taught her how to be so lavish
But for my wretched fate preserving
Who sees the dark on every hand?
Who never longed and never hated.
Who likes a bribe as much as meat.
All this lends charm to conversation.
But he refuses; he’s preparing
Who early found both death and glory.
Who does not drain the brimming cup,
But her good husband loved her dearly,
But her soul aches, and nothing pleases.
But here’s our lady unattended.
But here is tea: the girls demurely
All this is now outworn and faded,
Who cannot feel: he is too clever.
But in a corner who is standing,
But in my youth no one engaged 
All speaks of him, but to confound her;
But in their praises why be stringing
But it is late, he should be leaving;
But it was not capitulation
But journeys made in wintry weather
But just to tease your appetite;
But keep to their familiar ways:
Who called him everything that’s vicious 
All secrets safe. Tatyana sleeps.
But left him bored to a degree,
But let us rather now inquire
But like a shadow moves about,
Who by the high gods’ will is fated
Who best knows how to separate.
But love grew greater, unreqmted;
But naught avails her girlish wrath;
Whither Onegin in a flurry
White hand he swiftly smoothed his hair, 
But no! — straight down the steps to meet him
Yes, and the fear of the impression
But no, our paths have separated.
Whispers an outworn compliment,
But nothing hurts when you are playing;
But nothing offers consolation.
All point to her, and all combine
While winter’s carpet, softly shining.
But now a kind and simple father,
While the dull husband, fully knowing 
But now all minds are fogged and cloudy,
While round the tents that nomads raise
But now it’s time for the ballet.
While our sad rhymesters earn a kick?"
While in the garden’s lavish shade 
But now, ’tis as a house forsaken.
That poets feel, he lacked, nor knew 
While in the doorway took his station —
While in due time Monsieur replaced her,
But other fancies, dark and chill.
While doctors hemmed and women cried.
But our Onegin’s out of range
But reasonable conversation.
But scarce did consciousness forsake him
But seeing Olga wouldn’t read ’em.
While I lie lapped in rural peace!
But she in whom my thoughts are rooted.
But she prepared a conflagration.
But she took fright, our shy Tatyana;
While Cicero could scarcely please;
But silent as a sage he sat
Which told him that his uncle lay 
But soon was yawning while he raced:
But spend three hours before the glass,
But stepping forth she slips and tumbles;
But still she pants, her terror growing.
Which nowadays seems somewhat queer.
But that is not my pleasure now.
But that the wedding was deferred
Yes, but your horse will soon be sliding,
Which he declaims with ecstasy
But the provincial town affords 
But the sad ruin brought no sigh
But then he never read a page.
But then he paused, and with his narrow
Whereby the mind or heart is shaken.
But there’s no need that I dissemble
But there’s no rule that has not any:
But they demand a madrigal!
Where, set in alphabetic order.
But this gay circle I deserted.
But those good friends who were insistent
But though Onegin’s peace forsake him
But though the arguments are keen,
Where, on a rustic bench at last
But to endure I need one boon —
But to the garden let us race
But was true joy to Eugene granted 
Where, in the shadow of the wings.
Where you were born, or, as a beau.
But when he comes they notify him
That poetry is their affair.
Where winter-long you were so gay;
Where winds and tempests were forbidden,
But whither in such anxious haste
But who does that is only choosing
But wishes them away with speed.
But with a new interpretation,
But with the living truth aglow,
But worldly quarrels breed the dread
But worse, what now you choose to do!
Where will my naughty lad repair?
But years went rolling by, and then
All nonchalance and charm and grace,
But yielding to a dream’s distraction,
Where the quick sunbeams on it play,
But you, Bordeaux, I always treasure
All my past life has had one meaning —
Where the maids sang to keep from cheating
But, Lord, before the evening’s ended 
But, Muse, you must forget the past.
Where still the bloody ghost pursued.
Where spelling has been sadly spited,
But, gentlemen, you may decline
That our bright pristine hopes grew battered,
But, lacking them, the joy’s diminished;
The volumes at long last succeeding 
But, rain or shine, each day his coach is
Buyanov’s hand she has refused,
Buyanov leads off Pustyakova;
All life before us still lay fair.
Yes, deep within I had the feeling.
By Lensky and his love; light flashes;
By a dark hope of what might be.
Yes, jealousy’s attacks can seize us
Yes, now the door is opened for them,
By a sly dodge or ready jape.
Where she, with God knows who for neighbors.
By afternoon he will be waking.
All hustle, bustle, tell great lies,
Where moonlight silvered shrub and stone, 
By candle-light she rose and dressed.
By chance, these verses have not perished;
By dinner, tea, and supper merely.
By dreams of a far country shaken.
By facile conquest swiftly tired.
By grandmammas and grandpapas.
That only mediocrity 
By hate and dread, and strongly beat 
By her dull partner’s mood infected;
By honor’s dictates, was indeed 
Where love burned like a living coal.
Yet bidding the poor girl adieu,
By mental effort tranquilizing
Where long my buried heart has lain.
By new desires I am enchanted.
By night, in dalliance, sweeter far.
The beau monde*s burdensome conventions
All greeted and congratulated
By one emotion only stirred;
By one persistent thought he’s haunted.
By poetry and love, or sickened 
By solitude nowise dejected;
By some obscure presentiment.
By someone awkward and afraid.
Where is the saturnine betrayer,
By thaw and grimy steps defaced.
All greedy boredom’s progeny.
By the still stream, with dusk descending.
By the young Olga’s winning ways,
By this delightful counsel guided,
By this most black and vengeful mood? 
By those whose parts are not extensive?
By tiresome rhymes and vain regret,
By too-sweet tea, the ladies’ meekness, 
By what Tolstoy’s fine brush created.
That one be potted anyhow,
By words and looks insidious
By worldly approbation paid.
By your good friend, all without guile,
Calash^ kibitka, crowded sleigh.
Call it magnetic or hypnotic.
Where is the noble aspiration.
Can be surprised, who is not stirred 
All evening Lensky was distracted,
That no hope of renewal cheers?
Where is the burning agitation.
Can only curse his wedding-day!
Can shovel silver with a spade;
All during the ensuing year.
Where is he? Y'es, I know the one.”
Can you, so generous, so keen.
Cannot eclipse her neighbor’s quite.
Careless of others’ joy and pain.
Where he had met her ravished gaze.
Where guests disperse, or at a ball!
The bed-curtains; awake completely,
Yet soon they let down their defences.
Catch the first stirrings of the heart.
Where go, you madman, to forget?
Caught fast, she cannot get away.
Where entertainment was but scant;
That natiure’s season of renewal 
All children know the melody:
The bee deserts her waxen cell
All Eugene knew is past relating.
The day upon which they intended
All’s hushed: within the parlor, sighing
Yet, as a rule, despised mankind;
written at all. For a sample of the material that 
Alas, our poor Onegin’s smitten:
would be brought to their father, their hands tied 
Alas, it is not hard to guess!
Where did her sister take her grief?
Alas! the altar-fire is quenched.
Where are the storms of love and longing.
The day to come, what is it bearing?
Alas! by a friend’s hand was slain.
whom Pushkin admired.
You’d find the way of vice was hard,
Cherries and red raspberries.
Where all is silent, dark and drear.
Cold ashes hide no smoldering ember;
Come away, girls, come away!
Come here, my dear. Why, this seems all
Where Thalia as she’s gently napping 
Come seek the stream that slowly goes 
Where Tanya met him face to face.
Where I would loll, without a goal, 
Aind in a letter to a j&riend
Come, rouse anew imagination —
From Eugene: he was far too jaded —
Where’s youth (the rhyme comes glibly) banished? 
Where’er it goes, I am its lover:
Compelled young boughs, in sultry heat,
When, a Lyceum lad, I flourished.
Confide to it the wish she cherished.
Confound the senses suddenly.
Congratulations! Now we are

Consoled the lady quite completely.
Consumed with terror, Tanya, quaking,

Content in my old age to follow

Converse at ease, seem to rejoice.
Coquette believes; the old man dreams 
When with diaphanous pale light

When will you lose remembrance of them?
Could drain each morning bottles three.
Could hoodwink the inteUigent;
Ah, yes, at some far distant date,
Ah, yes, I knew such old wives’ tales,
When we see him nearing us.
When two feet tripped toward their lover! 
Could she but have foreseen the meeting 
Could show him an approximation 
Crossing the ballroom’s polished floor.
When they employed the mother-tongue;
When they discussed some weighty matter,
Cut off before his hopes could bloom;
Czar to France, where he began his service in the 
Ah, whither, whither did you flee?
Dared clean his nails in front of him —
Dark Melmoth fills her wuth delight;
Ah, spring, fair spring, the lovers’ season,
Dawn’s air is sweet, she does not feel it.
Daylong, nightlong, thus to be bid 
Dear Olga is his only matter.
Dear friend, before this heart is nmnb —
Dear reader, pardon the betrayal;
Dear reader, what you are about-
Deceit and gossip, rings and tears,
Deceit exists, but clings with tender 
Decipher epigraphs at sight.
When the deep shades of night are thinning:
When suddenly they’re visited
Deep in the dust that time has laid.
Deep tenderness; perhaps he meant it.
The fatal hour is past recall;
Deferring to my wealth and rank.
Delight is mingled with distress
Delphine: the leading character in a novel of the same

When springtime’s sun shines warm above: 
Describes in pensive tracery 
Designed for you so sad a lot!
Desires that are too keen to slake.
When she can only throw cold water 
Devoured Stendhal, the arrant skeptic.
Diana’s breast, the face of Flora,
Ah, once how fast my heart would beat
Dirk, door, eclipse, fir, ghost, ice, knave, 
Disdain sits silent in his eye; 
That my performance is infernal,
Displays her languor and her pride 
Displays to the indifferent crowed 
Disputing your small legacy.
Disturbed by ghosts of days gone by;
Diviners and Chaldean sages.
vil With a strange, secret exultation;
When scarce a lad, his heart was captured —
That morning, gay and debonair.
Do not be cross because I fail
Ah, dreams! where has your sweetness vanished?
Does Eugene drive? Yes, I suspected
Don’t aim to cover it with glory:
Aghast at time’s swift slipping sands.
When passion’s fires no longer smolder,
When once the breath of spring assails me, 
When on the ground you see him, stricken.

Across the pane a shadow edges:
Across the meadowland alone,
Their marriage was a certainty.
Accomplished in the end. Three cheers!
The billows covered them with kisses,
You also, youthful belles, belated
Abruptly down the incline bounding,
Above the domes of Moscow, dazing 
Above the chess-board they will sit.
Above it all, the wild applause.
The billows, while the shrouds are rattling, 
You are the helpmeet I’d be choosing:
About this common rustic view;
The blithest dawn in sullen clouds.
The truest source of inspiration:
About the self-same thing, this clacking 
About the past, what’s done and gone; 
About the hills and meadows lying.
You came in dreams: I feared to waken,
You handsome albums decorated
Abandoning his pleasant village.
AU jealous thoughts evaporated —
A youth, who on the snow seems dozing;
A young girl’s ardor, clear of guile.
A wretched ghost, a foreign joke
A worthy course of action finds: 
You haunts where I might stay in hiding. 
The blow of a malignant fate.
A white cap shows, all in a trice:
A welcome; it was not surprising 
A way for her; he’s happy if 
A wanton sigh was not worth mention:
A virgin of ripe years, accepts
You knew Ruslan and fair Ludmila;
You knew the answer — as you say: 
A trespasser may hope for pardon.
A touch, and the sharp cliffs are beveled,
The boa on her shoulders, and 
You know; besides, all lots were equal 
A thought was born, and grew, unbidden;
A thought in which he acquiesced.
A thing the winter could not chain;
You lectured me, I listened, meek;
A tender father, a good master.
A tedious season they await
A tavern tribune, chief of rakes.
A talked-of novel, rather hazy,
A tale of sentiment not new,
The bold hihitka swiftly traces
A swarm of thoughts exempt from blame.
A summer in the country, racing 
A sudden gust of wind surprises
You made me drunk in other days.
A starry host of choiring spheres 
A spirit brooking no dictation?
You may dismiss them as unfit
The bony hands, the sly grimaces;
A song across the waters drifted;
A soldier spouse and a campaign.
A soldier’s, wins us friends at Court,
A snowdrift stirs, it falls asunder:
A snowball down the hill goes tumbling
You may expect no less firom me;
A smile, Onegin is appealing 
A slender crescent riding high.
A simple monument is placed.
You may rely upon the fair,
You might be pleased — if so, advise me —
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
A series of fatiguing scenes.
A serf-boy takes his dog out sleighing,
A second, and a third he sends,
A scholar in a yellow shawl!
A rustic view that she found fetching,
You mothers, as your own once did.
A rival, or to catch him napping.
A regimental band is coming!
You prove you know, beyond a doubt,
A proper distance to allow,
A prize that chanced to come his way:
A precious pledge! The man was guided
You rustic Priams, and you gentle
A poppy could not match your face.”
You scarce can get a dish of pottage:
A pledge of every loveliness.
You seek: be it extravaganzas 
A place is found for every guest
A place for the old-fashioned splendor: 
You shone as with a nuptial splendor:
You should perceive udth eye severe 
A passing thought’s enduring trace
The boredom: nabbing the unwary
The box, where, regnant in her splendor.
You smooth his pillow and contrive
A northern ball in all its glory,
The breath of life would then infuse.
You spoke, my very soul was shaken.
You still retain the memory 
A nice old woman, plain but pleasant.
A monogram he found too mazy,
A moment, and the pair once more
A moment since, this heart was quickened 
A mocking demon stirs within me
You too, farewell, my curious neighbor.
A mirror on the moon, now waning;
A mighty music down the ages.
A merry tune that, all unwilling,
A man of sense, I am conceding,
A man of rank, his worthy father
You who will smooth in after days
A loaf is proffered, coins are taken,
You witness of that fallen glory.
You woodlands where I used to roam,
A lily of the valley blowing
A letter heartfelt, artless, candid;
A laugh would bring the pair together?
A land imagination hallows:
A kitchen and a fence below.
You, dreams of sacred poesy?
The trees in wintry silver gleamed;
A horrid shout assails the walls
A horn rang out, as in a dream;
A holy secret, and a voice 
A heart that had not felt a pang —
A haughty skeleton, and that

Expressing the discrimination,
A gossip, glutton, clown, and cheat,
A glum, and next a merry man;

Fair ladies who are sentimental —
Familiar hills, familiar alleys.
Far back to a lost spring, and we.
When all went out to say farewell,
A girl will more than once forego.
When a fine lady seeks to win me 
A gifted talker, he would chatter
A giddy fop, and cruel spleen
When Tanya’s tender message came;
When I was gone three years, and wandered

Fed by his slipper or review.
Feeling and thought with music’s strain.

When I am gone, and cannot know it.

When Eugene reached the restless season

First glory, and then wealth and rank.

What, in the country, when it’s dreary.

First: he accused himself of mocking

Fluff in his hair, with visored cap
Fluff up her hair as style commands.

For all the efforts she is making.

The way a Russian verse is turned.

For army service; kept the books;
For as it is, my style is peppered
For carefree youth knows no regret.
For dreams, and would have been a shame.
What sight thus fills him with dismay?
For epigrams, and was annoyed 
For four long years she had been ailing.
What shipments are in quarantine?
What pride, what grief, what thoughts of her!
For gossip is not held a crime.
The bullets are crammed down already;
What petty thought? What trivial feeling? 
A garden river-girt, and lo!
What passage, what remark delighted
For if they sing, they can’t be eating
For it is late, the shortest way;
For just those little slips of grammar;
What of the tryst, then, so iU-fated?
What more, my friends, do you demand? 
What more is asked? The world is warm
For me? Shall I yet see you winging 
For ravings that it may induce.
For rustic freedom thus delights,
What languor in her magic glances!
For such a life, I am afiraid.
For such mere trifles? Why repine 
That forms the ducklings’ paradise.
For the cotillion begs her hand.
What languor fills her lovely breast!

For the wild steppes’ barbaric tongues,

A gambler who won all the stakes,
The cab, to spare the feeble nag.
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
What hidden meaning in it lies.
For worldly shows and vanities.
For, sad to say, she loved another:
Forbidden fruits alone entice —
Forced me to tear my heart away;
Forget the feelings that held riot
Forgetting friends and city ways
Forgive me, then, for thus retreating. 
Forgive me: Tanya, from the start,
Forgive the tears you wring from me,
A frontier shattered by the war
That fine parquet can never muster.
Forward, with groan and grunt he lunges,
Found a white picture to surprise her:
Found nothing fit to fill his life.
Four steps toward a narrow bed.
Framed somberly by gentlemen.
The call of fame, for you forgot 
What are her reveries unspoken?
A fairy tale that lasts the night,
What anguished longing held me fast!
A fairy light about her playing,
French turns will please me in a sentence
The call to early labors dinning;
Werther, to be a martyr fated,
Friends, for the poet you are grieving,
Were proper people to engage;
Ail this is futile, and you know it,
Were ladies of a certain age,
A drop of the dark fragrant stream;
From all the heart holds dear, my blunder
From distant streets where cabs were flying, 
From early youth his dedication
From head to foot, in form or face.
From here he watched with thoughtful eyes
Were it not better, if before
That even thirteen-year-old misses
From misty Germany, Vladimir 
From nearby hills the snow, already
Were in no instance trained upon her,
From porch to court, and shadow-light 
From shipboard looming on the sight
From shipboard, thunder dawn, than I, 
From speech: you never would have learned
A drop of pity, you^ll forebear 
From the drawn bow the arrow leaping
That does not frighten anyone
From their twin lanterns as they go.
Young Tanya, whom I still hold dear.
From these the man might be inferred.
From thoughts of him she is not firee;
That day would soon be on the march.
Frost glistens. Mother Winter’s arts
Fruit of spoiled years, or green and tart,
Were greeted, with almost dismaying
Young girls, in passing, hushed their chatter;
The weak would mend life’s fraying thread;
Young love, because it is so blind,
Gay carriages, a goodly number,
A decent chap — ^like you and me?
Were banished by her animation,
Given to mournful reverie.”
Gleam white; the sleigh, more swift than steady. 
And strolling with the throng you’ll view
Glimpse of Terpsichore’s sweet foot. 
Glimpsing behind the distant bushes 
That by a sudden storm was drenched;
God’s servant, and a brigadier,
God grant it’s nothing! Welladay!
God grant you find some trifle here
Goes out at once, demands a horse.
Were all unconsciously revealing:
Gold pines, and live Limburger cheese.
Wept o’er her daughter as they parted,
Good neighbor who’s dropped in on me,
Good readers: a new face arrives.
Graved on the monument you see:
Gravely departed priest and guest.
Gray skies, and heaps of straw in billows
A danger to all lovely ladies,
Great ladies, far too proud to fall,
Great ladies, of whom he’d been fond; 
Young timid love, and that was shocking. 
Green tables are set up, alluring
Grew worldly-wise as life grew chilly,
The carriage horses, chilled with waiting.
Grieves for the wretch throughout her life,
Grow fond — out of sheer idleness.
Went raving mad or worse: became 
Guillot is standing, ill at ease.
Gulnare’s bold singer emulating,
Gustave de Linar: a character in Valerie, a novel by 
Went forth, in dress — a London dandy.
A crouching huntsman, ill -concealed, 
That burdened my Tatyana’s heart! 
A creature arid, cold, and vain.
Well I remember waves in riot
Wearied by what he had desired.
Had brought the fruits of learning’s tree: 
We yielded to delicious dreaming.
Had gout at forty, fat and flabby;
Had he been quicker in revealing —
The while Zaretzky with a sneer
Had her shy wistful heart been burning; 
We won good old Derzhavin’s blessing
Had marked the place; and, more attentive, 
Had shown to my enchanted glance 
Half-grave, half-gay, and with a flavor 
Hard pavements, like a coat of mail.
A country house he next may see —
Has been diluted heavily.
Has clothed a hopeless egoism 
Has found a refuge from the blast 
Has held the first place in my heart.
Has sent you, and I shall be leaning 
Has she the answer to the riddle
Has thrilled by night the silent dale.
Have acted with intelligence.
A cottage with two rowan trees,
Have been content to eat and drink,
Have cards and dice; and not for naught 
Have dimmed the golden coal; half-seen,
A cosmopolitan — or what?
Have learned how hearts can be tormented.
We win the game that w^e are playing.
We were in reverie transported.
Have passed since in a hazy vision 
We sing about a lucky maid.
Have seen such ladies, not a few
We show at aU times due respect,
A comrade’s promising career,
Have your own horses pull your coaches,
That at Very’s on credit he 
Having her album there to finger,
We shall have arched, cast-iron bridges
He’d catch the moment of emotion.
He’d had a glimpse of his estate;
He’d have disarmed the youthful heart.
He’d led a kind and simple life;
We scared patrols with blatant noise;
He’d suffer bonds again, provided 
He’d suffered j&rom such things for years.
He’d take his fascinating pen 
He’ll then resume till day is breaking
He’s dignified, he dyes his hair.
He’s done with women, and it looks 
He’s driven from the ball to bed:
We met by chance; /, though^ perceiving
He’s killed! The fearful affirmation
That argues a resourceful poet,
We careless fellows leave the fretting
He Hked debate, and sometimes rudely
He barely spoke; his urgent mission
We can’t please the fastidious.
He calls for help, in misery;
The cattle low; the nightingale
He came. And her eyes opened. Quaking,
He can no longer be enchanted,
We buy with timber and with tallow:
He caught the post with eager haste,
He comes upon her, as he enters.
He comes: a cork pops, up it goes.
He could forget himself completely.
We both had wearied of the game;
He curses women’s whim with force.
We both had played with passion, early
That ardent and most charming letter?
He did not die or go insane.
We’re put to sleep by moral tales;
He did not stir, but like one dreaming
He did not value letters much.
He did stop short of suicide.
He died a short hour before dinner.
He dined here. What fine gentlemen!
He dined, he danced, he fenced, he rode.
He does not cease his stubborn stare:
He does not even guess my pain.
He does not heed the mind’s reproaches,
We’re all Napoleons, we’re certain —
We’ll split apart the mountain ridges,
We’ll listen to the forest voices.
He early played the fond deceiver.
The chairs shoved backward scrape the flooring;
He feared that he had not incited
He feels that it must break with grieving. 
He fell from off a Kalmuck stallion.
He finds that no remarks occur
He first abandoned you, capricious
Watched fondly, in seclusion growing,
Was wooed by passionate young devils*
Was to be readily forgot.
He found the matter not too clear.
Was to a single occupation;
He gazes, and his heart is riven:
He gives his man the arms to carry
He goes in to the princess, quaking;
He had no itch to dig for glories
He had some other expectation?
He has a single thought to ponder:
Was the sad singer shocked to learn 
He held that loyal friends and steady
A classicist in such a fray.
He holds a stocking he was mending;
He hoped that in good time I’d marry
He hows to sundry friends; his mocking
He is the victim of remorse.
He is, though not renowned or quoted,
He joins the throng on the boulevard^
He killed eight years thus like a dunce —
He knew one constant inspiration.
He knew one torment, one delight
He knew the ruses that would brighten
He knew the task would sorely try him
Was the interpreter of dreams.
He laughs, and they are all guffawing;
Was sleeping, heedless of the clock;
Was reverie; she wreathed with dream 
He leads her, nonchalantly gliding.
He leaves the ladies’ hands unkissed;
He left his rustics to their tillage,
He let the classic laurel fade,
He let the summer season fly,
The chance to read his modest songs 
He lived — in summer rose at seven;
He lived in quite another age);
Was quite the rustic engineer.
He looked them over, boxed them right,
He loved as people love no longer
He loved me, and the dawn of life
Was our morose Tatyana’s way.
He loves you ... as a relative!
Was one that I found exquisite.
He marks the hour with some dismay:
He may pick up her handkerchief.
Was jesting subtly and displaying 
He might have gone to bed and died
He might have learned that life was shabby
He must be off without delay.
He never thought of the vexation 
He noted with accustomed malice.
He now repents him of the course
A brace of pistols and two balls 
He offered solace and delight,
He offers all a grand example;
He often paid a call, surmising 
Was it not you who gently gave me
That Ovid sang, that brought him here, 
He pens, with trembling hand and weak,
He pours out fluent melodies;
He quits his place of hibernation —
He quits the rout, and, meditating.
He racked his brains, and still believed
A book, a walk where shadows flitted
He read miscellany and journal.
He rescued them, and with the knack
He said, and found his words the cue
He sang life’s bloom and early blight:
He sang of parting and repining;
He sang the rose, romantic flower;
Was it not thus I long since spent
sudden. An observation betokening an experienced 
Your Olga’s face, so round and blooming.
Was he the carefree soul he seemed?
He sees forgotten foes, malicious 
A black-firocked monk, or if a hare
Was ever harder task invented?
He set the ladies’ eyes aglow.
He sighed, no longer subject to them:
He sighs: ^'They’re past the age — it’s shocking! 
Was bored with everything he tried,
He spared the rod to spoil the boy,
He spared us, true, one piece of folly;
The charming and ingenuous maid
Was bored again beyond all measure; 
He thought it no great loss — perchance
He thought the tomes his daughter kept
He thought: I must not disconcert him
He thrust his nose in right away.
He took his coffee here, and rested,
He took, and fain would be forgiven;
That I should see you once a week 
He turned a partial eye on it.
He waits with jealous indignation
He waits: and up a troika prances,
He wakes to find a note — that’s pleasant:
He walks into the empty lobby.
He wanted to converse with her
Was all the art of love required.
He was convinced the fickle fair
A ballroom tyrant, tightly laced,
The treasure none can ever guess,
Walked to the stream below the hill; 
He was not one to pick and choose.
He watched her as she played and sang;
Wades through the streets, if he but can;
He well knew how to set you laughing.
He who could never understand
He will lie late, and on Ms tray 
He wore a dressing-gown himself;
Your charm? My verses sang your praise; 
He would not play the base deceiver.
He writes a verse for her to dote on —
He yawns and starts to snore again.
W'hose raptures are forever stilled.
Headlong into a world unknown.
Your dreams, your high simplicity.
Held Richardson as dear as life.
Your frank avow-al touched me nearly.

Her chest heaves, and her cheeks are kindled

Her dove, her confidante devoted,
Her dowdy frocks, and to their mercies

Her dreamy mood did not consort
Her eyes betray her with a tear.
Her eyes shine, and her breath has dwindled.

Her rosy cheeks are not less bright
Her rosy innocence and grace.
Her sad fatigue, her helpless languor.

Her voiceless grief was past disguising;
Her walks are longer, she will dally
Her weakness, and she coughed and cried.

Hold your lorgnette up, watch them nearly.
Holding their pious habits dear;
Homeward, along the kitchen-garden;
Hope lies to them, and they’re beguiled.
Hope of a name none might forget.
Hoping her grief might thus abate;
Hoping to sell his worthless nags;

How ardently this breast was burning!

How heavenly, as she advances,

How many follies then were floating
How many swiftly flitting days

How noble was the tone he’d taken;
How oft on the dark shores of Tauris
How often, sick with separation,
How once I held her stirrup for her,
The child of shrewdness and of daring,
Upon voluptuous rugs instead.
How very welcome you will be.”
However dazzling to the sight.

Than other men are doomed to feel:
Upon the table, piping hot;
I’ve a suspicion, make me ill.
I’ve always thought well suited to 
I’ve drawn a likeness perfectly:
Than is the moon one sees at dawn;
Upon the table gleam the glasses,
Upon the streets the snow is lying,
I’ve married off my younger daughter,
I’ve scanned the pages most severely.
I . . . I’m in love,” she murmured low.
I And you, small fruit of eager labor:

I am assailed by melancholy;
Upon the sharp -clawed paw he offers,
I am not given to repentance —
I blame you . . . For you acted boldly. 
Upon the parlor sofa lies
Your pleasures with a taste more keen,
I burned, my pulses started drumming.
Upon the magic of that stream —
Upon the granite parapet.
I can’t go out: I cannot walk —

I cannot suffer the discussion —
I choke him with a tragedy;
I could not see it without gloating,
Your scorn. You did not find surprising 
I did not ache with such desire
Upon the good old-fashioned ways 
I fain would write a diatribe —
I fear lest in my supplication
I fear, friends, lest your patience fail:
I find the plain home circle dear.
I first resolved upon refraining

I frighten the wild ducks by rolling
I hardly read, I’m often dozing.
I hate red lips that are unsmiling,
Upon the finished product then;
I have no care for flighty fame;
Upon the dull mind’s slumbers break.
I have no tears, in spite of grief;
I have seen other belles who bent
I have them here for you to see:
I hear the magic of your voice,
I heard her friendly accents soften;
Upon the distant hills lay light.
I know there’ll be a warm reception
I know your heart; I need not tremble.
I left you in a dreadful fright;
I like a life of country quiet;
Upon the death of his dear father
I listened, not without elation.
I looked for peace in prayer, kneeling.
I lose the thread, my mind’s not clear.
I love fierce youth, my private passion
I love you (why should I dissemble?)
I loved your image even then;
I loved, and nothing could relieve me.

The wind, would enter, gently warning
I might (who knows?) have grown contented.
I might indeed make bold to borrow

Upon the chapters in your hand, 
I must be certain in the morning
(The image, why, of this and that:
Upon the boards still flutter free,
I pace the beach, await good weather.
I quote myself, and do it pat).
Upon the bachelor’s sad existence;
Upon the azure, pale and tender.
I reminisced of the attraction
I sadly call on each sweet name.
I say: give up a style outmoded.
I see the pain has left no trace;
I shall be true to him through life.”
I shall defy the dread ApoUo,
The window, where he read it through.
I shall not suffer the deceiver
I shall recall the tongue of longing.
Upon my dreaming soul intrude.
I strolled into the farmyard — faugh!
(Such is the sex, you will agree);
I take my leave of you — farewell.
Upon its staples, not on gold —

I trembled at your glance, and when
I trust that you will pardon me;
Upon his brow the mark of death,

I w-ould not praise you, but sincerely
I w-ould requite sincerity;
I wait: when once your look has spoken.

Upon her wrath her lips are sealed.

I was not bom for happiness;
This strange and sorry character,

Up to its roof was past all praise. 
In all the novels of the day.

Unutterably dear and fair.
Until, near dawn, his head was dropping 
Until the flames blazed up anew
Until a great discovery
In colored silks a pattern fit 
In cosy comfort, sleeping sweetly.
In cosy scenes of fireside life.
Unspoiled by the vain show and fleeting
In dizzy circles round and round, 
In dread of what this might forebode;
In dress a pedant and a fop.
In dust . . . But there the skies are bright; 
In elegiac mood, at last 
In endless reverie indulging,
In every nook, with strange emotion;
Unless indeed we send a card
In festive crowds, in solitude.
Tatyana, still an early riser,
Unknown to butterfly and bee.
The women mowing oft repair
In golden languor vaguely floating;
In gossip finds the spice of life,
Unhesitatingly she ran.
Unheeded in her great dark eyes.
Undressed at last and went to bed.
Tatyana, dreaming, walked alone.

In passing that my stanzas speak 
In praise of so much wit and charm.
In praises of his hardihood;
Two hearts, one may perhaps believe.
In runs his valet, prompt Guillot,
In saturnine romanticism.
In secret Tanya was repining;
In secret, of dear distant creatures.
In short, and I was proud of her.
In shouting fiercely: ^^Mine! She’s mine!”
In silence, hearing still the faint
In solitude without a flaw,
In soul, of all the guests the least 
Two hearts, a torch, and flowers, be sure, 
In still and somber beauty stand
In such a brief and tragic fashion —
In such a year, at such an age;
Two girls would come, and sadly twining 
Two fluffy furrows as it races;
In that swift moment one could see
In the dark hours ere Morpheus, flying,
In the mazurka, ’twas allowed.
In the same carefree lively way 
In the smart sanctum, all a -quiver,
In the soft luxury of feeling,
In the steep shade a camel lying;
In the thick grass where none can see,
In the unruj63ed heavens shining;
(A shrewd command that perfectly 
Tufted with snow; the stars are shining 
In this important sport the jaded
In this opinion all concur.

Town that’s delivered to the flood,
In winter, when night’s shade encloses
In worldly dazzle and confusion

Inane and petty, while the ode

Toward the moon her languid gaze,

Touched by the careless twittering,
Torment the rhymesters a la mode.

Took wilful passion for my guide;
Inflames the girl’s conceited face;
Took punishment once in a way.

The chilly dark the girl is sharing

Tatyana was her sister’s name:
It’s frowned on in society.
It’s late. Odessa sleeps, unruffled;
It’s like a mistress, gay, capricious,
To travel, you must be desiring 
Tatyana was her name then — granted.
''Then I was younger, maybe better,
It’s plain that here he is the master.
Tatyana trembled and grew red. 
It all pours forth from lips that tremble
It all, in detail, never fear.
To this were fribbling hours devoted,
It happened that a peddler tendered
It humbly asks romantic fame.
It is a phantom you are chasing,
It is my letter, don’t you see.
It is no wonder I am fretting . .
It is to parch with hot desire^
It makes no difference to her.
The tread of passion augurs tears:
It may be, in your glory flourished.
It may not be: without relief,
It means the people to whose faces
''Get up,” he cried, "Past six, I vow,
It waited on, for him alone;
It was decreed ... the will of Heaven
It was for you that I neglected
Tatyana took her silent way
To think the girl that he adored
It was today I met the beauty;
It wrong to scorn when pride commanded —
To these long letters and these tears.
Its classic grace draws in its wake
Its fateful harassments indeed
To the young ladies what was fated.
Its parti-colored pageantry.
Its passage, it has ceased to be.
Its pleasures, like the city’s, pall.
Its reckless growth: into the grave 
Its splendor among ancient trees,
Its tale of humble lives, where now 
Its waves on shores that rise up sheer;
Tatyana thrills with pain and pleasure
Itself upon its memories.
To the low grave, to sit and weep.
Tatyana stares in fascination,
Ivan Petrovich ne’er was keen,
To the kind invalid, and yet

Iviii To whom did your confessed devotion.
''But tell me, which one is Tatyana?”
Zaretzky and the honest fellow 
Just as the social rites demanded.
Just as the stars had left off dancing.
Just fancy who appears from under!
Just for a dash of lemon waiting.
Just for the sake of being heard.
Just here and there hard labor lately
To the inviting sea would fly.
Just now our roads are bad for coaches;
Just now, did I not see you flitting
To tempt with tender word and sigh
Just to enjoy the obsequies.
Zaretzky bit his lip, quite vexed;
K., who is so well known for the playfulness of his 
Zaretzky, once a jolly rowdy,
Keen air, and trots without a goad;
Keeping his morning coffee waiting.
Killed by familiarity;
Kind drones, and you who wisely savor
Kind habit soothed her sorrow sweetly.
Kind, cheerful nature, it is bitter
To talk and sigh, to jest or grieve
To take the letter up and seal it 
To take aim also — ^but just then 
Zizi, that asks to be embraced;
LETTER I know of whot I am deserving —
To tag each other, or to roam 
With a too wanton kind of fun.
Lamenting in new songs and dirges 
Late nights, yes, and a facile art;
Lay hid in all the prose they uttered —
To suffer prison, and would fly 
The classic trumpet, sword, and mask; 
Leaps for a knife, and Lensky falls;
"When did he get here, by the bye?
Tatyana shows no sign of caring
Lensky can scarcely trust his eyes.
Lensky was thought an eligible,
To stormy gaiety a traitor,
Lest they should miss us beyond reason
Lest, sick of pleasure, momently
Let’s call some time. Take my advice;
arabia.
Let critics carp, he will not grovel:
Let critics wreak their indignation
To stand, dear vision, by my bed?
Let me look back. Farewell, then, bowers
Let no sly reader be so daring —
Let not the poet’s heart know capture
To soil the sheets with flying quill;
To sketch a woman’s legs or head.
Lies spread the famous annual fair.
Life’s vista gleams before it yet.
To see a pedant in a bonnet!
Light nothings, spoken without guile 
To scratch her neck, and stubbornly
Like Byron, pride’s consummate poet;
"What ails you?” "Nothing.” So — away.
Like Hippocrene it sparkles brightly.
To say, with sorrow in her eyes:
To save his honor stood quite ready 
"What’s to be done? She’s not a child,”
Like a poor sot to shelter reeling
Like any illness: spleen, or plague;
To roam the forests, green and deep.
"These evenings? At the Larins’.” "Splendid.
To rest the nags: the halts were boring. 
To rest from loads I used to bear.
Like giddy youth forever swirling
Like leaves that in wet autumn stray. 
To reading, where a finger-nail 
The words again with stifled moan.
Like prisoners released in sleep
Like secret promenades in sleighs;
To promenade, as all do daily.
Like smoke across the azure drifted;
Like this decrepit publican?
Like this since first the world began;
Like those whom an old feud inflames.
Like to the moon in lonely pride.
Liked hearty guests who ate and drank,
The world’s oblivious animation.

Lo! the opinion of the rabble
Long evening pass, while he would sit

Long since her dreams had set her yearning
Long since with sweet disquietude
Long since, but notice if you please 
Look back she dare not; fear would blind her;
Looking too corpselike to be nobby.
Looks backward; lightning-like she rushes 
Looks round: the bear is gone, at least; 
To play with tender reveries.
Tatyana read no Russian journal.
Lorgnette in hand, our friend would wander,
Lost like a muted sound and vanished.
Love’s discourse, perilous, delicious,
To overhear what they may say.

Mammas and aunts who pry and peer.
Tatyana might be found romancing
To mourn his absence, and in vain.
May Heaven blast your page, amen!

The sudden soimd of hoofs! . . . She freezes.
May pay attention to his nails;
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
May wear the laurel -crown of fame,
Mayhap he would have been reputed.

To make a guest exclaim at it.
Tatyana looked as though she heard 
Must in this matter be your guide.
Must leave my hero, ruefully,
To love and idleness devoted.
Mute, motionless, and cherub -faced;
My Eugene through the winter tarried.
"I am in love; leave me alone.”
^"Go, leave me, nurse,” Tatyana said,
My Lensky’s fury grows apace;
To long to clasp your knees, and, throbbing
My Muse to a superb soiree;
My brainless pupil almost learned
My childish dreams, my tender years,
My conscience speaks — ^pray let me finish;
The world of glory thus bereaving,

To kiss the breast with languor laden;
My fondness for it is but slight;

To keep his hopeless ledgers clear.
My girlish dreams forever stilled.

My heart will as of old be shaken.
My high-flown fancies have departed.

My labors, yet perhaps this name 
Tatyana in the court appears,
To hurry them: he cannot wait.
My lips were envious of their blisses!
My little book. With you I knew
My little nook do not forsake;
My lively cousin now advancing.
My love, first warm, would soon diminish, 
"Has he grown tame at last, and mellow?
To horse’s stamp and human speech!

To hold the pistol straight and steady;

Nay, she must hate her brother’s slayer.

Near by, she saw the mansion standing.

To her a tiresome thing she dreamed. 
New sorrows come, my heart to fret;
New warmth has melted winter’s chain; 
Next day before the sun was high.
Tatyana does, expecting that the mirror will reflect 
No bard was keen as I to follow
No breath disturbs the warm still night.
No card-game, poetry, or ball.
To have your humble servant tell
To have two friends at daggers drawn

No finer, but just finicky.
No gift but weariness and anguish 
No grace, no flash of merriment.
No longer fearful of disaster.

No, passion never wrought for me
No, silent, wild, and melancholy,
No, soon the world began to bore him.
No, to he with you constantly;
To give me over to despair.
To get it, friends, do you recall?
None was so quick as he at trapping
Nor bends to fashion’s tyrannies:
Nor calls them, noons, for mustering;
Nor cards, nor gossip, chased his gloom; 
To friend and child and faithful wife;
Nor eases tears too long suppressed.
Nor from his greedy lips withdraws 
To free its wings, and frantic, pushes
Nor noisy games, nor foreign beauties.
To follow you with deep devotion;
Nor reckoned days as they went by,
Nor shown a fighter’s predilection.
Nor soothes the ache within her breast.
Nor studies such as pedants choose,
Nor was she found with head inclining
To find a Moscow magazine
Nor yet were her soft lips compressed.
To earn a smile, a dream, a tear.
Not aiming yet, advance four paces.
Tatyana cannot stop her tears.
To drown the jealous whispering.
To drink a toast to his fair neighbor,
Not hesitating to awake him.
Not hours when he fulfilled the duties
Not knowing in the morning where
"But you were married, nurse,” said Tanya,
Not like a cool coquette w^ho tenders
To disavow- it now-. I read
To darkness’ kind abode repairing,

Not pain, but death. Thus, sparkling whitely

Not what you have, but what you see 
Not with a notion of delighting

Nothing attracted his attention.
The coachmen round the bonfires tramp.
Now Lovelace’s renown is faded.
Now Olga sits before it, filling
Now Yule-tide brings its fun and folly.
Now cut the ice with scraping noise;
Now different scenes delight my senses:
Now five steps more the pair have made.
To crowding slaves on every side?
Now from the shed at crack of dawn
Now having given due attention
Now in his study he bethought him
Now met his spouse. The princess gazed 
Now my Onegin, keen as brandy.
Now my companions are inquiring:
To come today, and without fail.
Now on what flowers are they set?
Now serpentine she twists and wheels,
Now sleeps the scion of delight.
Now soothed by this anticipation.
Now southward swept the caravan
Now stirred? Is it vexation moving 
Now the mazurka’s strains are sounding.
Now through the open meadow faring,
To classicism doffed my hat:
Now" let me speak of something jolly.
O’er Petersburg’s dark pavements borne 
O’er her embroidery, designing 
O’ergrown. No wreath hangs on the bough; 
"Ah, then you know him?” "Yes, and no.”
"Ah, nurse, nurse darling, I am hounded 
"Ah, but the elegy is flighty.
To choose such moral tales as might 
Obeying the spring sun’s commands,
Obeys her feelings sans demur?
Tatyana cannot but be grateful
The cold pretensions to success.
Observe his closet well, and gage
Observe it with a yawn at last,
Observed the girl’s embarrassed air.
Obtaining, with himself to thank.
Odessa was my home then, shrouded
Of Cleopatra, but whose features.
Of Lensky’s troth there was no chatter:
"A story?” asked the good old woman,
^'And what of Olga?” is her query:
To cast forced shade upon the street.
Of Sundays, putting on his glasses,
Of a most tyrannous young fop.
Of all sorts; finally you hear 
To call it dirty is no lie.
To brush the shy lips of a maiden 
Of comme il faut — Shishkov, berate 
Of corks, with much the same attention 
The world would gain if it should learn 
xlvi The homage that the gay world tenders,
Of course, one should reward his gabble
Of curses: he’s gone home to change.
Of days long past, when he had been
Of destiny and its defiance.
Of distance, promising delight;
Of elegies at some far date 
xlvii A thread of smoke is upward drifting;
Of feasts and sundry foods and eke 
Of finding worn-out prejudices.
To answer when the lady speaks.
Of good and evil, and of science,
Of heels the stout parquet would quake,
Of heirs is heard, indecently 
To a toilette you must admire,
Of her demure provincial ways,
Of her own heart’s shy hopes and fears;
Of her researches quite forgets
Of high desires and deep regret,
To a new pose will he be goaded,
Of his old uncle’s illness heard?
Of innocent felicity.
xlvii But now my fate is quite decided.
Of jdowers, for our modest dwelling.
Of jealous pangs, and separation,
Of letters running to six pages.
Tatyana’s trouble; but each eye 
Of life has perished like a flower 
Of loud farewells and crying maids;
Of lovely lady, modish sir.
Of loves that to the grave endure;
xlvii Embellished with a little slander,
The columns of the city gate
^'Whose glances, quickening emotion.
Of old the ballroom used to shake 
To Olga. First they spin about.
Of plates and silverware increases,
To Moscow: it’s the brides’ bazaar;
xlviii By what a storm his heart was shaken:
Of quiet summer nights, how often,
The world, the ball, are both forgot,
Of seething hopes and giddy play,
Of silence he had lain at rest
Of snow, and wash her face and chest.
To Eugene, who at once goes dancing 
Of some imported wild romance. 
The year’s bright dawn with gentle greeting.
Of speech, and earn the mockery 
Of speech? For what malicious laughter 
Of such a manner, I’m pedantic.
Of syllables so musical 
Of that dread mystery, the grave;
Of that lost hour beneath the tree 
To -write in French . , . What’s to be done? 
^'Why did you leave,” the maiden asked him,
Of the wild geese, a noisy clan;
Time was when she would be composing
Of this cold world, his soul would bless 
Of those he wished her to forget!
Of tulle she wore in other days;
Of welcome are indeed heart-rending.
Of what is common, what is grand;
Of what, in fashionable diction
Till travel, as you’ll have inferred,
Of which Onegin never tired.
Of whom ’twas said throughout his span:
Till somehow the long evening’s ended,
Of worldly scorn, and thus are fed.
Of youth renewed beside these streams.
Till from his dressing-room he’d pass.
Off in a narrow lane, at last.
Off in the cotmtry we can say
ship and the inclemency of the climate, he returned 
Off to the ball as is required,
Off to the country promptly packed her,
xvill Sped shafts of satire at the nation,
Oh, Brenta! I shall yet rejoice
Oh, I have erred sufficiently
^AVell, how are the young ladies faring?
Oh, empty world! Oh, stupid folk
xliv You did not like me . . . That was bitter.
Oh, humans, like your first mamma.
Oh, land of boundless fascination!
Oh, once again will you be singing
The traveler observes and shivers 
Thus you, Yazykov, when affection
Old W’omen, boys with cheeks like cherries,
Old duelist can be malicious:
Old fogies all, chained to tradition,
Old monkeys of another age 
Old women smiled as she went by;
xlix The words of this most earnest pleader:
Olenka too began to yawn,
The years to rugged prose constrain me.
^^His days and dreams what man recovers?
On all but him! She never sees 
Thus sunk in reveries, he nearly
On down to where the river flows.
years of Anna’s reign, nominally considered to be 
On every single suitor’s hopes?
Thus once again he manifested
On foreign scenes to feast our eyes;
Thus he grew restless and decided
On her loose hair, her tears, and on 
On horseback; such close friends were they 
Thus grows a seed the earth has hidden 
On past the bright parterre, the lawn.
On scenes both various and motley.
On sentiment we draw the curtain;
Thus far away her thoughts are flying;
On the bleak steppe go horseback-riding?
Thus darkly drives the storm that shrouds 
On the first page there’s this confection:
On the streaked ice the sunbeams play;
On themes to which none now alludes,
On through the field the girl will ride, 
On us the favors that men crave;
On whom shall we bestow affection,
versationalist, who was a life-long friend of his.
Thus brilliantly begins the ball.
Once Vyazemsky sat down beside her
Once dwelt, two pines are intertwined —
Once free, and night will find me gloating
Once graced the devil’s own abode,
Once lechery that took its pleasure
Once more Tatyana’s heart is drumming;
Once more forsakes society.
One cherished fancy for another
One clownish fellow, idly leaning
One day when leading his battalion.
Tatyana’s letter Or but a tempter to undo me?
One foot upon the floor is planted.
One has a cock’s head plain to see,
One heard the crickets’ slender choir.
One hears the clicking of a cock.
Tatyana’s letter For days^ until another meeting.
One line, held in the memory.
Thus autumn gusts deal death and treason.
Thus a poor moth imprisoned seeks
One thing alone he loved, he breathed;
Thus a gray hare will quake with fright 
One thought must fill your heart with pain:
”You are the one that I adore.
One whose embittered mind finds zest
One whose warm kindness has no end —
Thus Eugene thought with melancholy.
Onegin’s form, Onegin’s face.
Onegin’s holy life; unheeding,
Onegin’s letter A trick worthy of detestation;
Onegin’s portrait has been finished,
Onegin’s taste for books had vanished
Onegin’s traits with mine comparing —
Tatyana’s husband is appearing.
Through spectacles, with failing eyes,
Through silent woods, and she discovers 
”Was all her life thereafter dreary?
Onegin fires . . . oh, hapless men.
Onegin flies to taste the blisses
Through empty day and idle night:
Onegin grips his pistol tightly,
Onegin heard the sweet confession
Three-fifty was the price bespoken,
Onegin now decides he’ll cater
Onegin searched the cupboards, finding
Onegin sits and drinks a health,
Three pairs of truly pretty feet.
^^Into my golden chamber^ comeV^
The young Othello is delighted!
Three ladies mention a soiree.
Tatyana’s bloom is all but faded;
Onegin was allowed to hear 
Onegin watches her, congealed:
Thought sermons fashioned to annoy;
Onegin, also far away.
Though there are people, most malicious,
Though once they praised my magic pen:
Onegin, frozen with despair.
The company could see no harm
Onegin, meet him, born and nourished
Onegin, need I ask you whether
Onegin, that familiar place.
Onegin, what shrewd line expressed 
Onegin, wiseacres aplenty

Or post-horses, if thus inclined.
Or prose and verse — ^in naught the same.
Or rouse a journalistic clamor.
Or shining with the summoned tear!
Or somehow couldn’t quite prevent it.
Or sweetly use the flatterer’s tongue;
”But for a season it will do;
Or touch to flame a rosy cheek,

Or was the time of sorrow brief?

Or when, the world about me reeling,

Or, lulled by Lethe’s quiet flowing,

She dare not lift, for shame and fear.
She did not speak the language well

There, when the tardy moon was shining. 
She found the margins most appealing:
There was a time when the portrayal
She glances at the road, distressed.

She had not read with fascination

She is not hurried, is not chilly,

There is the spot if you would know it:
She lacks the look of snobbishness,
She lies as though she has not heard,
She lies for hours, with sleep uncertain;
She likes the talk of haughty sages
There is no sparkle here of wit;
There is no sleep for such as she.
She looks at him in some dismay.
She looks on nothing with delight.
She looks, half soothed and half excited,
She lost her Frenchy airs and graces;
There is no calumny so deep.
She loves him still; and in remorse,
There is no answer to his letter;
She might return; yes, if permitted. 
’’Alas, poor Yorick!” he lamented,
She noted, trembling and excited.
She pickled mushrooms with her cooks;
She pinched her waist with tightened laces,
She puzzles till she is distracted,
She quaked at omens; all around her
She reads the sweet romance, and how
She rises as the morning flushes
She runs, he follows on and on;
ance of a comet.
She searches for a passage showing
and reads as follows:
She seems the image quite perfected
There is a dinner-party daily
There at her feet, as they would do.
There are no inns. In a cold cottage
She should go home, where guests are waiting
There a Circassian’s horse goes flying;
She sighs, she pines both day and night!
She sits with an untroubled air.
She sits with downcast head, too lax
She sought the path, but as she turned, 
She speaks to them as to old friends.
She stands, suffused with shy emotion.
There’s little here that’s exquisite.
She suffocates; she scarcely hears
She then, as love has power to do,
xliii This is the season eyes grow weary.
She thumbed her Martin till he knew
She too at length came forth, and nigh 
She trembles like a hunted fawn;
She waits: when will the answer come? 
There’s gloom and darkness all about;
She wanders with imagined lovers
She was affianced, but her mother
She was no beauty: that were fiction
She was not one of those who glories
She went. Onegin stood forsaken,
She whispered to herself: ’Tis he!
Then, with a look that showed her tiring,
She will not see him, the betrayer;
She would go stumbling down the road.
She would not win you by her face,
Sweet Lei now hovers o’er her head.
Then, hurry, hurry to the fields!
Shorter and shorter grew the days;
Then you will weep, but who supposes
Should cross her path while she was walking, 
Should giddy deity desire
Should howl absurdly: ^It is I!”
The younger beauties will declare
Shouts bravo in his sleep, and then
Surveying fallow land and plowed.
Show rapture or indifference,
Then wafted as by Eolus
Shows passion’s volatility?
Shy as the doe who runs alone.
Simplicity to her young dream?
Since Latin’s held not worth attention,
Since but a random education
Since infancy her only pleasure
Since the dead days of Romulus.
Since time, without my interference,
Since you were christened? Gracious sakes!
Then plunged into domestic labors:
Sing and bring a dashing lad
Surrendered his inheritance;
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
Sits down; the game is done — ^he goes;
Then liking grew: they met each day
Slapped servant-girls who were unpleasant;
Suppose your pistol-shot has ended
Slight errors have a choice effect.
Such vulgar scenes as these despising.
Smooth aria, the eager plea.
So Eugene preached and Tanya listened,
Then he presents the madrigal.
So Tanya bit by bit is learning
So be it! Now my destiny
So be it; but I had to speak;
So countrified, a bit dejected,
So different, first they bored each other.
So easily, with passion seethed;
So elegantly can devise 
So exquisite as sacrifice;
Such treachery who could forget?
Then he came up to her and said: 
So pious are they, so precise.
So to their destination straightway
So turning morning into night,
Soft glance, nor welcome sweetly caroled.
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Then flash with pride and flame with anger, 
Then fell again to talking of
Some dunce may yet pronounce as he 
Some fragment of his Northern art.
Some pages held a sharp incentive
Some, honor’s victims, scarred by war,
Some, prey to piles, or Aphrodite;
Something more certain to amuse.
Then disappointed beyond measure, 
Soon found a way to soothe her pain;
Soon the dry valleys will be blooming;
Soon, soon my soul will not remember: 
Then dipped into some vile review.
Spoke of divorce in her despair.

You hear amid the gay street’s fluster
You know the truth? What is the use 
A sweet remembrance to ensure.
A song he brings for Tanya’s pleasure.
A pampered boy, allured by pleasure.
You sigh, and think with farrowed brow —
You spend your time, I’d like to know?”
A housewife seems a perfect treasure!
A gay mazurka holds the crowd;
A frosty slight; the heavens muster

A dwarf, whose tail is quite a feature,

The country to the past is tender.
The country, and its dulness, bore you;
The couple stood, to say good-bye.
The couples as they whirl aw*ay,
The couples to the table swarm;
The tone the gentlemen employed,
The tom-cat calls the tabby
The creatures fancy animated;
The creditors began to gather,
The crooked trunks, the gleaming claw^s.
The crowd of house-sprites, blowing out 
The tinsel of unwelcome days,
The crowd, the hubbub, and the glitter!
The times improve, and better us!
The crunch of snow . , « a step approaches;
The curtain rustles as it soars;
The customs that our elders knew.
The dale is dark and vapor-ridden.
The darkened mind is clear again; 
The darling object was provided
The dawn shines ruddy; Olga rushes 
The day is done: he’s not replying,
The time run on, and in the middle
The day of busy cares is blessed.
Chapter I
The day was set, his heart elated;
Chapter V
The days speed by; before you know it
The dazzling capital, forgot —
The dead man buried, they were able
The dedication is addressed to Pyotr Alexandro-
The dining-room: on chairs they slumber. 
The dogs attack her, all but biting
The dolts that must be tolerated.
The time of tempting nights approaches,
The time came when he quite abhorred
The dread of vice, the fear of shame.
The dreaded one, the dearly prized:
The dream alarms her, and not knowing
The dream pervades her mournful moods.
The driver on his box we note
The throng with a mute eye commanding?
The three kibitkas customary
The end of the mazurka, and 
The enemies their mantles doff.
The errors are a trifle merely.
The exile from society
The thoughts of youth so high and grave.
The thirst for knowledge, toil, and fame.
The third day interest abated
The things that I concoct in lonely
The theme from which he ne’er departed
The faithful one is soon affected:
The family is well; they send you
The fashion of a bygone day:
Been married long?” ^’Two years.” whom?”
XXll The clock strikes ten: he’s off, he’s flying,
The theatre’s wicked legislator.
Deep truths, or well-drawn scenes — yet not
The fearful bill, unheeded, mounts.
The feast goes on, but soon thereafter
The terraced scene, the view unfolding 
The feast makes every move a labor.
The feasts where wealth and wit were squandered,
The tender torments, and the sadness, 
The fields’ and forests’ solitude
The fields with droplets once again), 
The fierce flames reddening the skies.
The tender leaves, but in the spring 
The fine keen wit of yesteryear 
The fire is out; the ashes, shifting,
The first clear picture is disclosing
The first gay snowflakes spin once more
The first shy rays begin to gleam;
The flash of wit, the flouncing dress.
The tender feelings and the brave?
The flower of life that blooms but once.
separately, with the following Foreword:
The foes stood by, with downcast eyes.
The foes! How long had they been parted
The tea. I note the hour, or nearly,
The foreign tongue is native to
The friend of wintry cottage nights.
The friends, without delaying,
The frightened maiden gathers strength
The frost-work o’er the panes was twining;
The frosts begin to snap, and gleaming
The frozen corpse Zaretzky places.
The frozen funds of intellection —
The talk is seasoned well thereafter 
The tails and tusks and bloody jaws.
The table shone with wax; they handed
The game he can at last forget;
The sun appears, a brief snow-flurry
The general, since such tributes flatter 
The gifts the newcomer possessed;
May pass me by or pierce me through;
The subject, give me your attention:
The girlish secrets of the heart,
The girls with Olga and Tatyana
The subject of an argmnent?
The glitter of the noisy press.
The glories of these frosty days.
The glory’s gone, I know not why;
The goal is there before them. Blazing
The golden bubbles rising lightly
The golden tongue Italians speak;
The good wdfe took her husband’s measure. 
The gossips ever are malicious,
The grandfathers it promptly urges.
The grove’s asleep. The wind blows chill.
The grove, the bridge, the lake, and on.
The guests’ sly glances were enough.
The guests are early in arriving.
The guests are greeted with delight;
The guests, arriving, hear their laughter. 
The hall is packed to suffocation,
The hallowed letters O and E.
The hammers on the ramrods knock;
The happiness of youth must pass.
The happy man who took no chance
The harbor is a busy sight;
The hat is cocked, the brow morose.
The haughty creatures may inspire
The haughty portrait of Lord Byron,
The hazy dawn commences coldly.
The street-lamps’ pallid substitute.
The stranger. At her frightened cry,
The heart recalls its ancient scars,
The strait-laced innocent beguile 
Ally or enemy, attend
The hearth breathes warmth, and all’s serene;
The hearts of both now spurned the flame
The heavens glow with azure light.
The helpless girl can do no more
The herd no longer drives his cattle,
The hero’s named, the work’s begun;
The highroad, leveled altogether,
Pushkin’s day.
The hoar-frost in the sun a -shimmer.
The hope on which my heart is fed?
The storms which shook it like a leaf
The horns and hoofs, the whiskered faces,
The horse who scents him snorts and quivers,
The horses scent the dead, and foam
The horses to an oak near by.
The hostess cries. Guests squeeze together,
The hot fat cutlets; you would say 
The hour called ^^entre chien et loup^^^
The hour for waking and for sleeping;
The hours allotted me by Fate,
The hours go by: they do not waken;
The house hummed like a hive of bees
The house rocks with applause; undaunted,
The housekeeper a slow good-bye;
The husband enters: the appalling
The icy river shows a luster
The idol of all maids in bloom.
The image trembling in the glass
The imps and cupids, quick as monkeys,
The insults time heaps on her head 
The jagged flint still harmless, lifted.
The storm and strife, the frequent feast; 
The joys they knew have all proved mortal.
The kindly fates had fancied me.
The ladies’ little feet fly by.
The ladies all pressed closer to her;
The ladies enter; now it’s gliding 
The steward came here when requested;
The ladies, each a picture when
The state relied, his friends were told. 
The lady of the house: she’s fled —
The land that knew my love, my pain, 
The landed gentleman has brought 
The stars of night are fair and many,
The stalls are seething, the pit roars,
The languors of a distant day.
The last chapter of Eugene Onegin was published
The spot itself was God-forsaken.
The lazy Orient longer dozes.
The leaps, the heels, the whiskers fair. 
The less we love her, sooth to say —
The splendid mansion shines and gleams, 
The letter shakes; she heaves a sigh;
The letter to you quite intact.
The letters that he wrote so neatly,
The lies that journals perpetrate,
The lifting mist reveals the pleasant
The lighted stage, and with a yawn 
The spirit of an oddish dreamer.
The lily -stem, and withers so
The little feet and lovely limbs;
The little tricks that are affected
The source of tears and happiness.
The loads on the kibitkas sway.
The sounding waves’ eternal chorus,
The lofty madcap! — but no matter:
The lofty passion, the pure pleasure
The lonely gloom was hard to bear.
The lonely thicket where a stream
The loss of it I could not bear.
The sound of Russian when correct;
The lovelorn boy ignored them quite.
The lovely ladies’ filmy dresses.
The soul so shy of happiness;
The lustrous tea-cups, never spilling 
The snow is reaching to her knee;
The magic of the bow obeying,
The maiden lies there, pale as death.
The maids and coachmen vie in swearing; 
The maids would gleefully foretell 
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The mansion j&rom its firm foundation
The mansion, hy a hill well hidden,
The marker on the balcony
The marriage-broker kept on pressing
The sly thrall struggle to be free.
The masses of your mountains gleamed,
The sleepless fellow’s heart and head.
The sky breathed autumn, somber, shrouded;
The matchless bore — on these she mused; 
The simple talk flows readily.
The maxims her mamma has taught.
The simple lines there graven, she 
The menu hangs there, in plain sight.
The merchant’s wife, so young and slender. 
The merchant, to the port is faring 
The simple girl whose dreams, whose ways.
The messenger was not kept waiting:
The mind’s reflections coldly noted,
The modern Russian’s worst disease.
The moment that I saw you coming,
The mooB’s enchantment so obsessed her.
The moon has risen; in a light 
The silent stars, the brooding moon —
The moon is fading with the night;
The moon, the lampion of heaven.
The most congenial of men.
The mother fell to figuring
The silent fields, abandoned, wait,
The mountain maid, untamed, inspiring,
The silence at long last is broken
The mystic, wistful hours of night;
The naked woods surprise the sight,
The name-day feast is soon begun.
The nasal twang she also banished.
The neighbor now declares: ''He’s killed.”
The neighbors’ heads and tongues are wagging:
The neighbors promptly called and twaddled
The neighbors, pleasantly diverted,
In our poetic reverie
The nightingale’s keen melodies
Napoleon.
The nightingale, this season’s lover,
The noble taste of bygone days.
The noise is queer and terrifying.
The sign with shaking hand, she prayed.
The noses blown, and without pause.
The novelist had long since won;
The nurse alone might well have guessed,
The nurse replied: "God save you, daughter!”
The old assessor, paralytic?
The sight of them produces spleen.
The old gray nurse thinks she is napping
The old man had no time to look
The olden sorrows I regret.
The shutters closed, the windows blear
The orchestra’s already drooping;
The other day in rainy weather
The shepherd’s horn awakes the peasant;
The shaggy monster seizes her,
The oysters? They have come! In rapture
The page he read could scarcely bore him.
The pail is brought, the ice is clinking
The painful dream forever broken!
The pair of us had planned to wander,
The parlor’s crowded; barking pugs,
The parlor hums with conversation,
The passer-by may read it clear:
The shades of night are growing thinner.
The servants gave him all assistance,
The peddler plods, the merchant dresses,
The pen makes mock of such as he.
The pencil-marks he made with care
The people’s lore of days gone by;
The servants gather at the gates 
The phrasing, awkward or mistaken,
The pile of books no longer read,
The pines, their boughs on every hand 
The pistols gleam, held straight and steady;
The placid course of rustic leisure;
The plain girl’s love? Why, even now,
The plan I had no pains to settle,
The plans to have been consummated,
The pleasures relished, triumphs thwarted;
The poet’s ardent speech, the mind
The poet’s earliest elation
The poet did not think of stopping
The secrets of the nuptial bed;
The poet in the very dawn
The poet is no more ... his lot
The poet lets his pistol fall.
The secret she will never mention,
The poet, and the world will follow 
The poet, swift in thought and action,
The secret shame with which I burned^
The science of the tender passion
The polite ”yes” that is behooving.
The poor girl stands there, almost senseless;
The poor old lady, broken-hearted.
The scene where first I saw your face,
The saucers of preserve about.
The pranks and jokes of former years.
The samovar, that blest invention,
The prima donna? The ballet?
The prince’s comrade and relation 
The prince invites him to be present 
The princess, and her feeble cries 
The princess, pale, in neglige.
The prisoned girls of the Salgir,
The profile that a move will blur
The promise of her spring was blighted,
The same consuming agony.
The purling of a gentle brook;
The ruts and ditches that abound
The rustic cyclop labors, daft,
The race of men recks nothing, save
The rain of passion is not cruel.
The rosy dawn brings forth the sun,
The rooms are thronged and hot and gay.
The relatives — and there are dozens —
The rings are plucked; each maiden, sighing, 
The rings that the new mode dictated.
The river and its banks are leveled;
The road is lost and past divining.
The rogue, who somehow would escape 
The roofs, the fence, all molded fair;
The room grows loud with talk and laughter, 
The room where the old man berated
The room, though not without a sigh.
The rapids and the underbrush
The queen, aloof, remote, imperious.
The quarrel grows; Onegin quickly
The proud lorgnettes the ladies hold
The press is thick, the hubbub loud.
The poor thing nearly swoons; she’s ill.
The poor shy girl whose adoration
The reason doesn’t really matter.)
The poisonous vUe worm that mumbles
The sea, the southern sun for basking . . .
The poet, with impatience burning.
The poet, and he may, forsooth,
The poet in his exaltation
The senses soon grew blunt and dull.
The perishable human crop.
The pattern of a paragon.
The sex, of course, is light as do’^m.
The passions, though, concerned more often
The shadows creep across the sill.
The ox with lowered horns must drag
The sharks who feed on gamblers’ passions
The other slowly circles, thus,
The opera summons — in a word,
The shutters open; chimneys spout;
The old fat counsellor, Flyanov,
The north wind breathes and bellows, driving
The music, he would whisper low 
The mother groans. "It drives me wild;
The moon her magic vigil kept.
The merry and monotonous round.
The meadows’ solitary look,
The matter for a fortnight; oh.
The masters of the berry -crop.
The sledge awaits. He does not tarry:
The master had no need to scold
The married rakes, no longer naughty.
The man? Or vanity, forsooth?
The magazines that like to scold
The snows still gleaming softly pink,
The lover’s language, the sweet vow,
The loud finale sounds, and pushing,
The local Paris: Petushkov,
The lively Muse was at my side
The lights, bewildering the rout;
The letter’s ready to be sent;
The law of Fate is ever just.
The square grows lively now and dizzy
The languor and the flame of love 
The language of the gods rejected . . .
The lady’s lasting admiration
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The jesting mixed with flattery . . .
The hopeful youth was quick to find 
The hero we’re intent upon.
The strains of Albion’s proud lyre 
The heart with virgin tenderness?
The heart once more with hope will glow.
The heart of the confirmed coquette!
The girls, off by themselves, conspire;
The girl, stands rooted to the spot*
The gentry all cried out in scorn,
The gathering, affected by it
The gamblers, worthy men and bold:
The gallants for their hostess vying.
The furnishings are plain and stable.
The talk would turn with strange persistence
The folly of a simple girl:
The floor is oak; two chests, a table,
The fiery glance, he could but find
The few who relish toil and teen).

The feast he was quite unprepared for,

The fear, the shame, are past endurance . . .
The fair young pilgrim must go home.
The thing that makes the world go round.
The fair ones, whom you were addressing 
The faces one meets everywhere;
The eyes of the ingenuous young;
The eyeglass of the connoisseur.
The editor has followed closely the text of the first
The drum is heard, the city’s rousing,
The double windows, the snug fire;
The time had come — she was in love.
The door swings wide, and Lensky’s here,
The day my father gave his blessing;
The cruel fates have surely not 
The crowd whose sparkle nothing dims,
The creature bellows in reply 
The courtyard white, a white parterre,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The country round about was still,
The cordial words: 'There was a poet!” 
The company commander, whom 
The city soon will wear resounding
The charming lad was rather wild.
The bud that just begins to blow.
The blood that burns tmth frantic fire;
The bear says: '^Here my gossip dwells.

The baker’s wicket opens out,
The arms are crossed — a well-known pose —
The album of a country miss,
The afternoon of life is starting,
The Russian envoy rescued him and sent hi m as a 
The Nereids’ low murmuring.

The version of it given here 
The Moscow belies are many, too.
The Academic lexicon.
The very words Onegin wrote.
That trembles with another’s passion; 
That silently you spoke to me.
That shows a statuette of iron:
The vision of a peerless girl,
That she’s ideal — he must jot 
The voice of mistress, foe, and friend,
That only once in a great while.
That huckleberry syrup will,
The waters, where they boil and toss;
Who will not seek our faults to flout us?
That could not very well be worse.
The well-known clubman, who, God bless us, 
That bodes full flowers and honeyed fruit. 
The while she howls both long and loud;
The while we hear the woodland sing?
That I am not Onegin’s sort;
That’s where the eligibles are!”
That’s fine, but if the truth were told.
Than halt bewildered on the shore.
Than face them; he who has gone through it
Tell fortunes, too, but otherwise:
Tatyana, terror-struck, is waking . . »
Tatyana, spell-bound, lingers still.
The woods, Tatyana stayed at home,
Tatyana, breathless, caimot stir;
Tatyana should be settled, too.
Tatyana sets the door ajar . . .
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana goes, impelled by love.
Tatyana burned and shivered, asking:
Tatyana’s solitude adds fuel
The wretched story out, complete —
Tatyana’s match was ail the rumor;
Tatyana’s letter lies before me,
Tatyana’s brilliant catch discerning,
Tanya, her silken belt untying,
TO ONEGIN Dispel my doubts! My mind^s awhirl;
Suspicious age could do no less,
Such stuff as Lafontaine has written . . .
Such is the news he’s eager for.
Such faithful friendship as my hero’s
Such are the bard’s gratifications;
Strange woes that left me broken-hearted . . .
Strange Jean Sbogar enchants her too.
Their freezing glances framed to hurt you.
Straight past the porter, like an arrow
Stood thunderstruck. He could not stir.
Their looks enchant, their words are sweet, 
Steep cliffs above the ocean’s purl,

Then Olga’s suitor paid a visit.
Then all is changed. For lo! she veers,
Spring calls you to the verdant soil.
Then buzzing, all sit down to dine.
Sounding the cry that all was well;
Sometimes he reads to Olga, trying
Some clue the index may afford her. 
Some charming spot to hold her still.
So he returned, took Chatzky’s cue.
So Heaven wills it. Your young soul 
Slow eyes come last to rest upon 
Sleepless, Tatyana would converse 
Sits home, awaiting the reply;
Sing a song, a happy song.
Then they demand in compensation
Showed him so cold and calm a brow?
Then what a poem I’ll contrive 
Should I not give the letter’s text 
Then, aiming at his pallid brow.
Then, at a party he attends
Shines the resplendent southern sun —
Then, in the flower of his youth?
She will not find her meadows there.
Theocritus and Homer bored him ;
She walks ahead. The old crone mutters:
She stifles here . . . her heart is sore.
There Shakovskoy brought noisy laughter
She shuddered, mute; her lovely eyes
She shared our banquets, crowned our joys —
She sees a court she does not know,
There bold Fonvizin, freedom’s friend,
She sees . . . Why, who would credit it? 
She seemed a stranger to her own.
She has no trace of coquetry —
She loves the secrets that environ 
She hears it all at every visit.
There is no notion so erratic.
She looks about, with heart that flutters:
She looks about in puzzled sort.
She lacked her sister’s charm, and wanted
She hears the raucous laughter swell 
There is a roaring in her ears . . .
There sings all night; wild roses cover
She loves an uhlan with devotion . . .
She glides; and now serenely stops,
There was a time when the impassioned
She gazes at him without pause . . .
She found in a romantic story
She followed, as he did, the fashion;
She fears the dream bodes only ill.
Therewith a bottle of light wine,
These artless lines can never bore me.
And I was just thirteen years old.
She does not breathe, she does not stir;
refuge from the fires that were ravaging the city.
These proud reflections all portend:
She did the overseeing; cool
She conned the talk against her will;
She cannot. No? But why? She’s given
She can no more, her strength is gone*
She bade me hear the waters sing,
They’ll cock the trigger and let fly,
They’re duller than the things we write.
She’s wearing raspberry.” "Yes, you
She’s at the window — always she! . . .

Search Russia through, you’ll scarce discover
They dared not let their voices drop:

Out from the house the serf -boys fly,

Our native tongue turns up its nose
Our grandchildren evict us too.
This Martin Zadeka, it seems,
Orestes vied there with his friend,
This ditty sounds for Tanya’s ring:
Ordains it so: I am your own.
This ever -rapturous hero, burning
Or when through liveried throngs he’s thrusting
Or wait for her hot cheeks to cool.
This is no rhetoric I’m using:
Or on the sheet another wrote on,
Or on the garden gazes out . . .
Or more times JBrom her Moscow cousin, 
This subject filled his conversations.
This too was the old master’s nook;
This way is of all fates the worst.
Or love, the grave concern of youth?
Or like, up in the silly sky.
Or letters that a girl might write.
Those lovely lips; is it not true?
Or is stupidity malicious —
Or in the shoulder feel a touch
Or in the end will he just be
Or in a fit of blind vexation
Or gloriously served the world;
Or does he follow his old bent 
Or climbing down the rocky shore.
Or by the fiureplace set at rest.
Or are our thoughts in truth so cruel
Open the window; come, sit here.”

Onegin, and I loved you; well? 
Onegin without hesitating
Onegin turned to Lensky next:
Onegin took the letter to
Onegin sleeps and does not worry.
Onegin leaned above the river
Onegin fumbles as he seeks 
Through lofty tree-tops everywhere;
Onegin a pure rapture felt.
Onegin (I return to him).
Through the dim room where I am sitting.
One window glimmers bright and rosy.
One who has lived and thought, grows scornful.
One thing alone to think upon 
One takes a risk in such discussion,
One saw the cheerful morning smile;
On your protection till I die . . .
On the far bank the smoky fire
On stilts the bold pedestrian
On other paths, since youth is spent,
On hearing this, Zaretzky started
On everything and everyone:
On elegance her mind w^as bent.
On balls I also used to dote:
Thus to rush forth, then lapse in quiet
Oh, yes. But there’s the whirl of fashion.
Thus, for an evening game of whist,
Till Lensky, too absorbed to look,
Of youthful pranks and childish pleasures, 
Of wintry pleasures; you will dote 
Of which I’ve lost the habit now.
Time was when all the world was vying
Of this and that, to his distress;
Of the Black Sea upon the shore.
Of speech to this insulting passion.
Of some attractive little thing.
Of seeing you by afternoon . . . .
Of prejudice’s ancient yoke,
To Olga’s voice: away she went,
Of park and palace, dome and spire,
Of memory, or welcome rest,
To Tanya of the days that were;
Of him had filled his simple youth,
Of her companions in the blue.
To an ambitious author’s whims:
Of fools, and slyly whispered quips ...”
Of fables, and a grammar too.
To be his relative’s sole heir.
To be united to his own,
Of any nonsense I set down,
Of all the dreams the heart can hold.
To call that friend of freedom wrong.
Of Olga’s looks alive to me.

Now with what eager concentration
Now nearer! Galloping . . . and here 
Now from the dish where they are lying
Not now. I love my hero truly.
To decent folk, and with a smile.
Not long the Larin house was waking
To do full justice to the table,
Not for you our songs are sung.
Not deep or learned or intense.
To dwell on sorry things so long.

Nor, from the loge and the parterre,
To face our foes as all men must,
Nor yet the cuckold, stout and haughty.
To flowery field and village sport,
To flute and viol’s merry sound.
Nor read the ending of the story.
To fondle either parent never
Nor full of idle chat and silly;
Nor distance, changed his earnest mood
To gather tribute from the dell.
Noise, chatter, on the table shine
No, when with youth and love on fire,
No sound, save for the soft slow roar
No sooner did the cannon, sounding
To gossip; but her heart would fill 
No savoir vivre^ no hint of verse;
No rival in the girl’s affection . , .
No punishment is equal to it.
No more my Eugene could discern . . .
No fancy of a worldly mob.
No coarse mot of a witty snob.

Night falls; the moon, already riding
To hear the vulgar chatter there.
New leaves for those the tempests scatter.

To learn my Eugene’s air of scorn.

To leave such quiet haunts as these 
To leave, is gone; they let time slip 
To let the tender habit seize me;

To liken do-re-mi to wine.
To listen to you, late and soon;

To love all ages owe submission;
Mute anger only marks her face . . .
Much to enchant his virgin mind.

More than a brother’s love for you.
More lingeringly half the world.

Low cunning must assist devotion
Love your own self and so have done!

If only you were with me still,
If friends and kin are undeserving.

IV Of making certain grand concessions
IV How often, by her tales diverted
I was a dolt and could not sing.
I try to glimpse it; but I trust 
I throw myself on your compassion . . .
I tasted all your joys with zest;
I share the scalding tears you drop:
I read not to the crowd, but only
I read a shy, confiding word.
I must say candid words or none.
I must admit the sorry truth,
Upon the couch, a riding-crop.
I moved there also for a while,
I liked, and his peculiar pose;
I know that life is but a bubble,
I have no faith in its requiting
I have known women, stern and rigid.
I found you good, and I attest 
I drag myself about; timers hasting.
I called Odessa dusty —
I call on freedom — ^naught avails:
Upon the nameless river’s shore
Upon the oak her tufts are hung;
Upon the pages everywhere 
I bow and cede my rights to you . . .
Upon the patriarchal dust,
I am deceived by no illusion;
I The taw^dry glitter of her vesture.
I’ve haunted the ballet — what for?
I’ve finished cantos nine, no more;
I’m sad and cold, and yet it seems 
I’ll tell no ghostly tales, or gory.
I’ll have a duel with my friend.
I’ll give the censorship its due.
I’ll bring them to the altar then . . .
I’d bring you nothing but distress.
How sad it is to be forgetting!
How changed Tatyana is! How truly

His head above her fondly bent,

His doubts: for meet they surely will 
Vladimir Lensky, handsome, youthful,
His doubts were never past the curing,
His door he locks, his lamp he trims.
Vladimir too had odes to write,
His cup of tea with rum deserting,
His courting now was minus zest;
His appetite for pleasure’s hearty —
Highways to make the country one.
Here, mornings, he would read his book . . .

Here not a wit was found to shine
Here’s bronze and china in profusion.
Here’s Pradt and Scott. You do not think
Her soul was waiting . . . ah, for whom?
Vlll And I am not exaggerating
Her mind with agitation seething,
Her lowered eyes agleam the while,
Her languor will not let her move.
Her heart, and when she likes, 'withdraws, 
Her heart assailed, where’er she went 
Her growing doubts they cannot still.
He yawns, for serious labor tries him.
He would implore the shy confession.
He waved his hand, as one who’d rue it
He was none of your poetasters,
Wants one thing further, more’s the pity;
He was a veteran in love.
He trembles, cannot say a word,
He talked about the wealth of nations;
He soon consigns them to perdition. 
Was but a boy, if truth were told.
He set his mind to work with zest.
He seems, indeed, an alien here,
He savors the few words that settle
He paid the Muses honor due;
He might have altered and deserted
Was love: he sang it late and soon,
He marked the time, and presently
He loved the dark and shunned the daytime,
Was pleasure happiness in sooth
He looked the poet, when he’d let a
He lays her down upon the sill.
He lay most strangely there at rest.
He knows dehght when he’s adjusting
He has it still — a touching note,
He frowns, and everyone is still;
He found the fairest faces null;
Was with Tatyana — ^not, forsooth,
He found it puzzling but alluring;
Was yet a thorough Russian; hence
He fled their noisy conversation
We’ll go together , . . Oh, my chest! . . .
He early knew the agitation
He dropped his eyes in irritation
He drinks: with greedy howls they swill;
He did not know that books could say things

He counts the slow hours, vainly trying
He cannot give me happiness.”
He came, unripe, unto the tomb!
He bowed to her without a word.

He’s read and read, and pray, what for?

He’s in, and flying to the mill.
We need the wit that nature gave us

Have there been any conflagrations?
Have played a prank in coquetry.
We think good wishes are the thing.

Have paid to folly what’s her due.

Had chased him and had quickly caught him.

Forgotten bridges rot and sink;

What does my future hold in store?”

For trousers^ dress-coat^ and for vest;
For thus he brings his passion’s fuel

For learning takes an utter fool.

For friendship’s sake would I were writing
For epigrams it would be splendid . . .
For all their views and passions not,
For all that musty rhetoric.

For (as I’ve said) there he must sit 
Flings wide the door; his caftan’s torn,
First snow, and delicately wrote 
First let us prick his vanity

Fate had arranged it otherwise.

Farewell! Forever, or for years?”
Extolling you in tones of fire!
Exceptions may be hard to find,
When dawn’s fiirst ray had barely shown;
Even the pistol and the sword.
Even Didelot becomes a bore.”
Eugene was apt at keeping still;
Esteemed emotion, feeling none.

Enough. ’Tis time that I presented

But now the blue of evening darkens.
But now her reason and her will 
But now adieu, oh, golden playtime!

Behold each generation flourish,

Will look with scorn on my distress!

At least of some complaint arthritic?

With caution through the key -hole spying
At last, by night, arrived the snow*
At last he rouses, opens wide
At last for whom her heart is yearning 
At giddy feasts and wild discussions,
At fifteen feet: his aim was good.
At dawn tomorrow, near the mill;
At bottom, and, too bored to think.
At a soiree. '^God! to see her! . . .
With every church in bright attire.
Asked who she was, set straight his wig,
Aside all timid thoughts, forgetting 
As though she feared an inquisition
With flashing eyes Onegin rises
As that of one beneath a spell.
As she says gently: ^^Rise; have done.
With frowning brow he would be sitting 
As my confession. Why say more?
As he comes near; it’s no illusion:
As grateful as a kiss, as simple
As custom bade; with charm and spell 
With his own pawn takes his own rook.
As I am, too, a little rest:
Are you a guardian angel to me?
Are quite forgot- The path is now 
With hope, then prove it an illusion,
Are glad at last to take a rest:
Are far too pleasant to seem long.
With jealousy revive it next.
With joy the contemplative soul!
Are cordial to the country cousins.
Are all your relatives quite w ell?
With laughter and with noisy sport.
Are all but flowing; her heart flutters,
With most folk, custom’s rule prevails.
Approached her pillow, she would raise 
Another neighbor tapped his skull:
Another landowner come newly
Another day: he still is dumb;
Another ! . . . No, I could have given
Another’s joy her heart possesses. 
Announces it is dinner-time.
With perfect fireedom she receives him;
Anew the garrulous fond lyre?
And, feeling they had done their best,
And you, skilled pupils of Levshin,
With rebel will and lively mind.
And you, my reader, wise and witty.
And you, my fair ideal, too,
And yet, were morals not in question,
With scorn; yet smiles upon the lips 
And yet Odessa, our wet city,
And worn in comfort, far from town.
With silver hoar, the meadows lie . . • 
With skill and passion, touch and smile.
And wore — her last defences down —
And with enamored eyes to see
By any wife who’s virtuous.
And with a somber splendor shone
With studied ways amused the crowd
With sudden passion, sudden pain . . .
With tea and jam, and endless tattle
And with a cheerful eye to greet you ! —
With the coarse salt of malice, while 
With the ninth wave the ship’s arriving
And whispering, make quite a stir:
With those Chateaubriand could write;
And while the world in silence slept.
And where two pines their shadows fling
And where one falls, another surges . . .

With you, nor yet with you who spin 
And when, besides, her heart was wrung:
And when their wives talked, it was worse.
And what of my Onegin? Drowsing,
Within the hill -encircled valley
Within, a noisy clatter swells;
And what a throat! And what a spirit! . . .
Without a tavern of its own.
And walk him in the afternoon.
And w^ho could wield the poet’s pen. 
Worthy of him I am addressing,
And w^ept his father and his mother . . .
Would be dismayed to see him there;
And turns to what is hers no more:
Would chide him, would forgive him soon.
And tunnels under water, too.
Would dare to seek that gentle girl?
And trusted her with house and pelf,
Would drop so tenderly at even . . .
And truffles, luxury of youth,
Would fly the place: she cannot stir;
Would gallop side by side with me!
And took his medal for a toy
And to the final pages turning.
And time would pass, and there would be
And thus reduce him to confusion;
And throws this challenge in our teeth:
And this routine was to his taste.
Would start a quarrel quite as shrewdly, 
And thin, but pretty, more or less;
Would, in a body, call at eve.
And they delight to see it flow.
And there were those who said they knew
And there she stayed, and wept, and wept.
And then the wayward course of passion. 
And then once more till noon sleep sound.
And the opinion of the town . . .
And the long evenings black as ink.
And stares unseeing, in no hurry
And some harsh judges found, forsooth,
And solitude — this was, in fine,
And so, my home was then Odessa . . .

And she — she who for Tanya posed . . . 
And sharing leisure, thoughts, and food,
And sees the gaping fiends of hell:
And seat the two friends hastily.

And one may find a mirror lying
And on their skates the merry boys
And on her lips a careless smile.
